         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thinking that to be idle, which their idle braines cannot comprehend: and ſo iudge them to be phantaſticall (as is the manner of ignorant men) which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing beyond their reach and the compaſſe of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: thinking the world to be no greater then the Cages of their

For though meat<note place="margin">Theo. 3. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> and drinke, be both neceſſary and good, yet they may ſay (by the ſame concluſion) becauſe they haue ſeene many ſurfet by it, that (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) it is nought: whereas (indeed) it is not the vſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but the abuſe, for as it is the nature of moſt men to thinke that which they moſt affect to be the beſt; ſo many men in their particular knowledge, thinke themſelues the wiſeſt, in that they doe beſt conceipt.

And therefore no maruaile, though there be ſo many Horſes ſpoyled, being taught vpon vntrue ground.</p>
                  <p>For (as the learned ſaith) <hi>Quod nemo didicit, nemo docere poteſt,</hi> it is hard for a man to teach that to another, which he neuer learned himſelfe.</p>

For he is accompted a good Horſe-man in other parts thereof if he can but mouth a Horſe, make him take his way willingly, trot handſomely, and turne readily in a yeare, (although to his trot hee hath a naturall inclination:) and yet they doe expect that a Horſe ſhould be brought to his pace, with the reforming<note place="margin">k The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of haſt.</note> of all things aforeſaid, in ſuch a ſhort time albeit hee thereto hath no inclination.

                     <p>Alſo there are others which like the hand, but diſlike (as they may very well) the abuſe of it; for they haue ſeene ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">m. <hi>Pract. 1. li. 32. Chap.</hi>

But theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are the worſt of all the reſt, and their wayes to bee eſchewed as a path that leadeth to the vtter ruine both of the ſubiect and diſgrace of the Art, for through their diſtaſtfull hand, they vtterly deſtroy where they ſhould build, and make his mouth ſo inſenſible, that where the Horſe ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">n The diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue by the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the hand.</note> thereby, the more hee feeleth the hand the more hee reſts vpon it, and is the cauſe of ſo many run-awayes; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tireth a man more to hold him to his pace then the hardeſt trotter, and cauſeth a Horſe not to ſtumble only, but alſo break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the largeneſſe of his ſtroake for his pace, in regard he is ſo terrified in the mouth, that he dare not ſet his forefeet forth, which makes him fret and chafe and ſhake his hinder parts very vnſeemely, and to conclude <hi>quid non?</hi> Wherefore I could wiſh that all ſuch profeſſors were weeded out of the <hi>Vineyard of Horſemanſhip,</hi> as not worthy of growing there, becauſe they bring ſuch fruit as doth more diſtaſt the ſences, then giue any odoriferous ſmell to the vnderſtanding of this Art. By this time I hope their mindes are ſomwhat altered, which hold this Art ſo eaſie that any one may vndertake it without any great doubt of performance; which if they are not, I would know what<note place="margin">o Errors the cauſe of varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>Theo.</hi> 36.</note> ſhould moue ſo many ſeuerall opinions and variable inuentions for the performing thereof, if there were not ſome intricate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therein? And what ſhould bee the reaſon that ſo few Horſes amongſt many goe well, but onely the Art being ſo obſeure that they cannot ſee the way how to effect it? For though mens opinions are variable, yet there is but one truth, and although there be many great diuerſities in Horſes going,<note place="margin">Theo. 4.

                     <p>And yet although they will grant ſome difficulty in it, yet (by the abbreuiation of time) they will hold it more eaſie then other trades Mechanicall, for hee is accompted an expert and cunning Workeman that can learne his occupation in ſeauen or<note place="margin">p Men iudge according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> eight yeares; and yet they thinke that this Art of pacing may be learned in ſeauen or eight Monthes. But the reaſon heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1013:20"/> is, this Art hath a cloake to couer their ignorance (which is the nature of the Horſe) but the other hath none. For in other Trades they are very deſirous to obtaine both the intellectiue part by learning, and alſo the practicke by exerciſe, and ſo to get a habit of cunning, that when they come to work vpon the ſubiect, they may make it formall, the facilitie of the hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">q Where there is no excuſe there men take paines to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their own credit.</note> directed onely by the Iudgement of the eye, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportionably made, the worke doth continue as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be; and after they haue the knowledge thereof they can make a hundred as good. But if it bee not ſo fitly wrought nor ſo curiouſly ſet forth, then the fault is not attributed to the matter, becauſe it would worke no better, but to the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did worke no better; and therefore in regard they would not be accompted Coblers nor Botchers, they take great paines to keepe their reputation, becauſe they haue none other excuſe.</p>
                     <p>But in this Art it is otherwiſe, for whereas thoſe worke vpon bodies <hi>inanimata,</hi> hauing neither life nor ſence, ſo that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer<note place="margin">r The cauſe of intricatneſſe in this Art.</note> their hands doe, it is ſo; the Horſeman worketh vpon bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>animata,</hi> which haue both life and ſence, and though he worke neuer ſo exquiſitely, yet if the intellectiue part of the Horſe be not agreeing to the minde of the man, it is a ſhadow of the thing but not the thing it ſelfe, howſoeuer it doth ſhow to the eye, for when the Horſe commeth to be made vſe of, then he ſheweth the truth and (as a dog to his vomit) ſo goeth he to his former diſorderly will: for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>quales ſunt actus, tales habitus fiunt,</hi> as is the teaching ſo is the learning<note place="margin">Ethick. 2. li. 2.

But for their excuſe, then they affirme (<hi>vno voce</hi>) that it is the nature of the Horſe, and ſo they attribute that to the efficient cauſe which is in the materiall, and by that meanes neuer take any paines to find out their ignorance, whereby that if by chance they make one good Horſe, they for the moſt part miſſe in ten.</p>

                     <p>Now therefore becauſe confuſion is ſuch a peſtiferous diſeaſe<note place="margin">Application.</note> that it impoyſoneth the whole ſubject which it doth poſſeſſe, I would deſire all young fauorites of this art, (or which meaneth<note place="margin">b A man muſt firſt learne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can teach.</note> to be laborers in the <hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man will haue a true inſtance to know a well going horſe by, I muſt referre him to the creation, (in regard all mens workes are fraught with errors) for then, God made all things very good and perfect, and let him there imagine (ſo well as he can) how he was before mans fall, and at that marke let him aime (ſo neere as is poſſible) and then the nearer his horſe doth goe to that perfection, the better hee goeth and nearer the truth.

And the hand is alſo to cheriſh either with the great end of the ſwitch, with clawing the horſe betwixt the eares, holding the reſt of his body firme without motion, or with clapping or clawing the Horſe on the necke or ſhoulder which will (much) fortifie his well doing.</p>

Euen ſo, the cauſe of thoſe horſes which are accounted ſad, doth not proceed from the weakeneſſe of nature, (for many of them are of a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger body, then the other,) but from the ſtubborneneſſe of his deſire or luſt, (in that he taketh more delight to follow his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, then obedient actions,) ſo, that he will doe no more then he is forced vnto, and that (alſo) which he doth, will be very vnhandſome, and vnſeemelily done. And further they obiect, that thoſe horſes which are of a thicke forehand, ſhort necked, dead mouthed, and vnnimble bodied, will very hardly, (or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) be brought to any good riding: and verifie it alſo by my<note place="margin">A retortion of the ſimile.</note> ſimile, for thoſe men (many of them) which are of ſuch an idle diſpoſition, had rather ſtarue or bee hanged, (as dayly experience doth ſhow) then to take any diligent or painefull labour.</p>

                     <p>But the horſe (in regard hee is an vnreaſonable creature) doth not make his election by conſultation, but <hi>per appetitum or fugiens,</hi> for when he doth any thing, (that is contrary to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination) he doth <hi>per fugiens,</hi> rather yeelding to obedience, then to hazard the deſtruction of nature, (he hauing a naturall inſtinct of ſhunning (if the man haue knowledge how to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his firſt yeelding;) and then afterward he maketh his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>per appetitum,</hi> he obeying with delight, and then if hee be once brought to obedience, (the man hauing knowledge<note place="margin">

But I would not haue any to vnderſtand me ſo, that I vtterly diſallow thereof, for then I ſhould take away the chiefeſt Inſtrument which doth period and ſhut vp the perfection of the horſe. For I hold that there is not any horſe, (of what diſpoſition ſoeuer) that can be brought to the height of his grace, except he bee truely commanded therewith; becauſe no man can worke ſo couertly as he ought without it, in regard it doth exclude all apparant helps and corrections. And therefore when the horſe is come to ſuch perfection that you may vſe the ſpurre, then (both for your owne grace and your horſes) you muſt vſe as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert motions in your corrections as can bee. But the chiefeſt<note place="margin">
                           <hi rend="sup">b</hi> The true vſe of the Spurre is very neceſſary.</note> thing you muſt know heerein is to iudge when you ſhall vſe it, leaſt through the ignorance thereof you metamorphoſe it, and ſo vſe that for a helpe which doth tend onely to correct, as I haue ſeene many doe, and I my ſelfe done both to my great toyle and vexation, and alſo to the tormenting and terrifying of the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe it is the chiefe concluſion of the Worke, and it is like fire and water, for as they are good ſeruan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And againe, you ought to know the vſe of all the other corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as I haue ſaid, that they may be a perfect ground for him,<note place="margin">A good reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</note> whereby he may the ſooner conceiue the cauſe of the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: for he that doth put his Horſe to the correction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, at the firſt, doth reſemble them that put a ſcholler to the Latine tongue without the knowledge of his rules.

                     <p>But for the better clearing hereof, you muſt know that all the corrections are, as appendixes one to another: and therefore in the manner of correcting, you muſt goe <hi>gradatim,</hi> that is, if<note place="margin">

Wherefore you muſt be carefull to vſe the ſpurre accordingly (as hath bin declared) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alſo a regard to the diſpoſition of the Horſe, and then you ſhall bring him to ſuch true command, that he will performe, what you wiſh, with great eaſe and delight: for when he doth feele (but) the couerteſt helpes (you can vſe) he will obey with what willingneſſe you would wiſh, or deſire.</p>

For inſtance, if the horſe be ſo ſlow that he will not obey the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your body, to goe forward willingly, then ſtrike him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, with the iuſt ſtroke of the calues of your legges: but if that will not preuaile, then you may correct him with the Switch, vpon the right ſhoulder, which (as I haue ſhowne in<note place="margin">

                     <p>And here likewiſe you may obſerue what combination there is, betwixt Art and Nature; for like as nature hath giuen to a man (for the moſt part) to be more apt and nimble on the right ſide, (both with foote and hand,) ſo hath it giuen to a Horſe alſo the like aptneſſe on the left. Wherfore when you are ſeated on your horſes backe, then are you ready with your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

For as the Sunne receiueth his light immediately<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> from GOD, and thereby doeth inlighten, both the Moone, Starres, and the Ayre: euen ſo, the Horſe receiueth the firſt command of his deſire from Man, and ſo giueth motion to his Winde, action to his Body, and gouernment by the Head.

                     <p>For, the Horſe may bee ſaid to bee the Ship, his appetite the waues, his wind the gale that doth force it forward, his head the helme by which it is guided, and the man the Pilot to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the voyage; and if the Pilot want knowledge to ſteare the<note place="margin">The Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Helme truely, the ſhip is in danger of Ship-wrack; euen ſo, if the Man haue not iudgement to gouerne his Horſe true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the head, all his labours are in danger of confuſion.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, as I haue placed it as the laſt Character (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) by the which the diſpoſition of the horſe may be knowne, ſo is it the laſt obſeruation that you ſhall haue for your refuge: For if there be a defect in any of the other, it may be perceiued in this, when it is obſcured in them.

Or if he be looſe-bodied and trifle in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1013:64"/> hee ſhall feele the looſenes thereof by the hand, in regard hee is ſo tickle mouthed that he will not reſt vpon the ſnaffle, (as hee ſhould) to ſtretch his body forth to make a true and apt way.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, when you ſhall finde any of theſe to intercept your expectation, doe but examine theſe foure ſeuerall obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and you ſhall finde the cauſe to proceed from ſome one of them, and eſpecially from the two former: it happening from the rebellion of the horſes diſpoſition, or elſe from your ſelfe, through ignorance of the Art, by the which abuſe it is<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now if no man heretofore could ſet forth or ſpeake that which would pleaſe all ſects and ſorts of men, ſhall I (that am the meanest amongſt the meaner) thinke to plant this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyard ſo perfectly, but ſome Calumnies will ſeeke to deſtroy this planting? Nay, but I muſt arme my ſelfe to endure the reproch of the moſt, ſo much the rather, becauſe I differ ſo much from the traditions of the Antients, ayming more to diſcouer the errors of mens, as the chiefe cauſe of abſurdities then the diſpoſition of the Horſe. For I know I ſhould haue pleaſed many better if I had layd all the fault ſtill vpon the nature of the Horſe, and haue giuen them liberty to follow their owne wills, for it is more conſonant to man to ſtudy to inuent ſeuerall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to inflict vpon others, then to ſeeke any reformation in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>And although to you Gentlemen and Countrymen, to whom I haue beene more familiarly acquainted, it may be thought that the fruits of my labours are idle, as the courſe of my life, to ſome hath beene thought to be, becauſe I did not addict my ſelfe to gather wealth as is their miſerable inclinations: Yet if they whoſoeuer ſhall haue ſuch an vncharitable conceit, will but reſpectiuely weigh my earneſt deſire by knowledge to build againe this now decayed Art; they will I hope giue mee thankes for my diligent paines, rather then condemne me of vaine prate, and oſtentation, for as much as there is no vice that ſhall ariſe in this Art, but there is ſufficient remedies for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For as it hath pleaſed God to giue me an ability of minde, ſo hath he alſo giuen me ſome light how to polliſh that excellent part: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:1013:82"/> that no man can purge his ſoule from error (the dam of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed opinions) except he ſeeke to beautifie it with ſuch knowledge, as is conformeable to reaſon. And therefore I haue beene alwaies a vowed auderſary to the opinionated vulgars, who hold that felicity doth conſiſt in adorning the body with wealth, rather then the ſoule with knowledge, and ſo doe pamper the ſhadow, but ſtarues the ſubſtance. For thereby they are kept in ſlauery to their wills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually inuironed with griefe in getting, and care in keeping.</p>
                  <p>For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, he that delighteth in this world muſt needs fall into one of theſe two griefs, either to lack that which he coueteth, or elſe to loſe that which he hath gotten with great paine. Wherefore becauſe wealth and knowledge are both vnſatiable (although they be contraries) yet the one is certaine, and the other vncertaine, I haue continually deſired that which is the more certain and durable, and haue leſſe troubled my ſelfe to gather wealth, being ſo inconſtant and ſoone waſted, then knowledge it being as permanent as the ſoule: for of it the more that a man doth impart, the more it doth increaſe,<note place="margin">(d) 1. <hi>Pr.</hi> 11. <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</note> but of the other the more that is beſtowed, the more it doth waſte.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of which made <hi>Pithagoras</hi> to diſpiſe thoſe riches which with liberality are waſted and loſt, and with ſparing doe ruſt and rot.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (Gentlemen and Friends) ſeeing that the mind is the cheifeſt part of the man, and the greateſt glory that a man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in this world is to enlighten it with knowledge, I haue taken the more paines, to plant this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyard of Horſemanſhip, and to dreſſe and purge it from ſuch weedes as may hinder the young impes from floriſhing therein, onely for the good of my Country, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of which I was onely borne: For the which my hope expects b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For it is a miſery to ſee how pur-blinde the moſt be (who make opinion the director of their actions) thinking this Art to be ſo eaſie that it needeth ſmall inſtruction for the knowledge thereof. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that what Horſes they make good is by chance,

But to let them alone, frying on the gridiron of their ſearing conſcience, whoſoeuer doth deſire to be an impe graffed in this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyard, and deſireth the title of that generous quality, muſt ſtriue to gaine to himſelf thoſe foure Cardinall vertues which are in euery noble ſpirit. For he muſt haue Prudence, to worke diſcreetly and orderly without confuſion, euer examining his workes by reaſon, and not by his will. Hee muſt alſo haue Iuſtice to proportionate his helpes and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (equally) according to the Horſes diſpoſition. And likewiſe hee muſt haue Temperance, to ſubdue and refell the rebellion of his will and affections, when they ſhall be prouoked thereto; And laſtly, hee muſt haue Fortitude, to conquer the vnrulineſſe of the Horſes diſobedience. Any of all which if the man be defectiue (howſoeuer hee may iudge of him-ſelfe) he is as farre from the truth thereof, as he is from drowning.</p>
                  <p>And though this Method may be thought more Ethnicall then Caualarie, in regard it doth treate more of reformation in the Man, then of teaching the Horſe. Let them know (if they right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand themſelues) that it doth derogate nothing at all from this Art: for Man being a reaſonable creature, is ſaid to be a King and ruler ouer a Horſe (being vnreaſonable) and becauſe no Man can rightly rule, except hee hath firſt learned to obey; therefore he ſhall neuer truely know how to command his Horſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt learne how to command himſelfe, for what ſpeculatiue knowledge ſoeuer a man hath, if he hath not an actuall gouernement, it is but a ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore (Gentle Reader) although in theſe my ſimple workes thou ſhalt finde me groſe, vnlearned, and barren of ſuch liuely graces, and guifts, as (indeed) ſhould be full fraughted in the braine and vnderſtanding of him that will vndertake to ſpeake of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Art, for to content the moſt; I therefore deſire thee most heartily, fauorably to beare with me, and my good intended mind, and friendly to accept the ground of my earneſt good will, in regard I haue done my beſt: for ſith there is none that hath naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,

For although the horſes colour doth not abſolutely giue teſtimony vnto vs of his goodneſſe, yet I ſay that it doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate vnto vs his diſpoſition (in ſome part) as well as his ſhape doth: For nature hauing no defect, (God being the Author thereof by his prouidence,) it doth frame euery part of the<note place="margin">Metap.</note>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1013:87"/> ſame matter, whereof the whole is formed: and therefore the Colt being formed of the copulatiue ſeed of its Sire and Dam, receiueth the ſame quality (ſo farre as reaſon can teach,) of the foode that they did eate which did produce the ſeed, wherefore<note place="margin">

                     <p>For vpon this I dare pawne my credit, if you haue a Colt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bay, Blacke, Darke or Iron-gray, Glead-hued-gray, or Sorrell, if they haue no whites (eſpecially in their forehead) one may boldly ſay that Horſe to be of a dogged and ſullen diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the rather if he haue a ſmall pincke eye, and a narrow face, with his noſe bending like a haukes bill. But yet I will<note place="margin">
                           <hi rend="sup">d</hi> There are horſes good of all colours.</note> not ſay that all thoſe Horſes which are of the beſt reputed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, doe proue the beſt, becauſe I haue ſeene to the contrary, for ſome Horſes which haue beene of ſuch colours as haue been accoumpted the worſt, as bright Sorrell, and Mouſe-blacke, with Bald faces, and all the legges White aboue the knee, that haue made Iades of the other.

                     <p>And as it ſeemeth to keepe them warme, it doth ſet forth the beauty of the horſe, and doth (in ſome ſort) demonſtrate his diſpoſition, for as the Schooles hold, <hi>Omnis rei pars, eandem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam cum toto participat:</hi> Euery part of the thing doth partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the ſame nature with the whole: But howſoeuer the colour may be changed either by the Sunne or the Ayre, that

                     <p>Furthermore, whether the cauſes of ſuch variety of colours in horſes doe proceed firſt from the elements, and ſo from the complections, I make a doubt: Although it is holden that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry horſe doth receiue his complection according to the nature of that Element which is moſt predominate in him, and alſo his colour according to his complection; vpon which I will not inſiſt but ſleight it ouer with a ſwift foot.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe it is a rocke too hard for me to penetrate, there being ſuch diuerſities of opinions, that the diſcuſſing thereof, would rather require a whole volume, then a part of a Chapter. Secondly, becauſe the approbation thereof doth not appertaine to this Treatiſe, therefore I referre it to thoſe Arts to which it doth appertaine. And laſtly, ſeeing there are ſaid to bee but

                     <p>But becauſe I would not ſeeme to make my doubt vpon a preiudicated opinion without reaſon, I will only touch the two exceſſe colours, which doe not conſiſt of any other, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphiſicks<note place="margin">
                           <hi rend="sup">1</hi> White and blacke are ſaid to bee the eſſence of the other colours.</note> opinion for the cauſe of them: Now they doe define white thus; <hi>Albedo eſt color ſimplex in corpore teniore, multa lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minoſitate conſtans:</hi> Whiteneſſe is a ſimple colour conſiſting in a thinner body with much light. But whiteneſſe is alſo found in a body of more denſity, as in Marble, and therefore that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a true definition. And againe, they define blacke thus; <hi>Nigredo autem est color in corpore craſſiore, exiguae luminoſitatis particeps:</hi> But blacknes is a colour participating in a more thick body of a ſmaller light.</p>
                     <p>Now there being wordes of the comparatiue degree vſed in both, the definitions cannot ſtand with the Logical propoſition of the eſſence, for it is the nature of the eſſence not to admit more or leſſe, but heere it is ſaid more of the light to bee in<note place="margin">

But being ruled by Man they ſhall not ſpend their ſeed, by any diſorder, for they may both of them be brought to the height of luſt before they<note place="margin">How to make your Mare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the horſe</note> come together. For when as you haue refined their ſeed to a perfect temperature, by the order ſet downe in the ſixt Chapter; then for the better ſtirring vp the luſt of the Mare, let a little ſtoned Nagge wooe her two or three daies if need be, till that you ſee her haue a deſire to take the Horſe, then take him away, hauing a care that hee neuer couer her. Then feed them both well, ſome fiue or ſixe houres before night, that they come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and that the food may haue time to concoct, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh all the parts of the body: whereby they will haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtore of ſeede.</p>
                     <p>Then haue the Mare into ſome cloſe place, and let the ſaid Nagge wooe her againe, in the ſight of the Horſe, which will greatly prouoke both their luſts. Then let the Mare ſtand ſo, that if it bee poſſible the horſe may haue the heigher ground, that he may couer her the more cloſly: and aſſoone as he commeth<note place="margin">How to vſe her at her firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering.</note> off, let one caſt a pealefull of cold water at her ſhape, which will be a meanes to cauſe her truſſe vp her body, and ſo receiue the ſeed more willingly, and let one preſently leape vpon her back, and put her to a good round Trot for a quarter of an houre, for that will be a meanes that ſhe ſhall not haue time to caſt her ſeed: but in any caſe let him neither heat, nor ſtraine her.</p>
                     <p>Which done, haue them both into the ſtable, and let them ſtand an houre or two without meate, and after feed them well that night: and the next morning either giue each of them a warme Maſh, or elſe let them be ridden to the water, and vſing them as formerly hath beene ſhowne, let them drinke

                     <p>But whereas ſome hold that once is ſufficient, for her to bee couered, becauſe the Colt is begotten at once, and alſo the firſt ſeed is the ſtrongeſt, and therefore oftner is ſuperfluous, and weakeneth the ſeede. To which I grant it is ſo, that once were enough, if men knew when that once were, but it is doubtfull whether the Matrix wil be ſo open at the firſt, as to receiue ſuch a quantity of ſeed from the horſe as ſhall equally temper the Mares, which if it be not, then the ſecond or third time is more certaine, and therefore this order will make it the more ſure.</p>
                     <p>And there will not be any great doubt of weakening the ſeed, they hauing ſuch intermiſſion of time, to recouer their former luſt, if they be well fed in the <hi>intrim,</hi> which will preſerue their ſeed hot and ſtrong.</p>

And where it may be ſaid, that they are the more foggy, and ſo ſooner cauſed to ſweate, ſo likewiſe they are more purſye, and ſo for want of winde, they will ſooner obey: for the raking of the winde is the onely marke to ayme at, for the knowledge of gayning obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                     <p>But becauſe I would not haue men languiſh any longer, of ſuch a braine-ſicke diſeaſe; let them know aſſuredly, that if they vſe a Colt (of what diſpoſition ſoeuer) according to the true vnderſtanding of this Method, they may take his backe, and make him goe forward willingly, without any yerking, plunging, lying downe, or any other ladiſh qualitie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by his firſt backing, you may iudge whether you haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him as you ought; for this I haue had experience of, that a man may backe a young Colt, if hee bee rightly vſed, to make him take his way gently (without tricks) as well as to teach him any other leſſon; for it is alſo but a leſſon.</p>
                     <p>And this may reproue them that will aduenture to backe a Colt ſo ſoone as he is haltred, and ſo make great bragges of their knowlege, which is as commendable, as thoſe husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note place="margin">A confuſed courſe.</note> which will laye graſſe together in Winter ſtacke, ſo ſoone as it is cut downe before it hath time to wither: for as this will cauſe mow-burning and moulding, ſo the other will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the melting of his greaſe, (if hee bee of ſpirit and fatte) and alſo cauſe many reſtiffe qualities, which will aske farre more time to reforme, then would be required to keepe them from them at the firſt.

                     <p>But becauſe no potion can be diſcribed, or confected, to cure this deadly diſeaſe, of wilfull negligence and ignorance, I will let them continue ſtill in this obſtinate infection: and ſeeke to preſerue the yong imps (of this Vineyard) from ſuch contagious and infectious diſeaſes. And therefore when you haue prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your Colt ſo, that he will ſuffer you to doe in all things as I haue ſaid: then you ſhall cauſe him to be Bridled and Sadled as afore, and looke that you haue a ſpeciall care, to put the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine,

                     <p>And againe, if you put it too low, you may bruſe the tender<note place="margin">Note the true place of the head ſtraine.</note> griſle thereof; and further, by pulling it ſtraight, you ſhall pinch his Noſtrells, whereby his winde will be ſtopped from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall paſſage: either of which will be accounted a groſſe abſurdity in the horſeman. Therefore let it be placed below the nether-moſt part of the ſtrength of his noſe, iuſt at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his noſtrell.</p>

                     <p>And likewiſe the Minor is proued by the ſame place, for thoſe inſtruments are the executioners of a Tyrant, which forceth by feare of a greater euill; ſo that if they will not preſently obey (according to his will) they ſhall bee lacerated and tortur'd, whereby they are forced to yeeld ſodainely with the outward<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pra.</hi> 14. <hi rend="sup">i</hi>.</note> parts, although the inward parts bee ſtill rebelling.

Wherfore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by induction, ſeeing thoſe Inſtruments do work by violence, and violence is ſuch an enemy to this Art, and Art is wrought by the ſofteſt and gentleſt means to gaine obedience; therfore I commend this head-ſtraine and trench aboue all the other, in that they are ſufficient to command either young Colt, or any

                     <p>The Maior is proued by the Metaph: for nature hath giuen<note place="margin">Meta.</note> vnto all horſes one and the ſelfe ſame materiall ſubſtance and nature, ſo as there is no new thing in any <hi>indiuiduum,</hi> that there ſhould need any new inuentions for ſeuerall qualities, in as much as euery ſingle body doth participate of the vniuerſall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pr.</hi> 13. <hi rend="sup">h</hi>.</note> and ſo all reſtiffe qualities proceed from one roote, and one cauſe, which is diſobedience, and therefore no ſeuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, although they vary in diſpoſition, which is increaſed by rebellion, through abuſe by mans ignorance, in not knowing, how to apply his Corrections accordingly: For, to reforme any one euill qualitie in all horſes, doth require as many ſeuerall applications, as to reforme all in any one; for if there were a Horſe that might bee ſaid had any naturall euill quality more then any other horſe, then he might bee ſaid to be a more horſe then another, which is groſſe to conceipt.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is proued, in as much as this Art doth tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to a meane, therfore whatſoeuer is differing therefrom, doth decline to either of the extreames, and ſo repugnant to Art: And therefore, ſeeing in all the actions of a Horſe, there is<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 36. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>.</note> but two chiefe things to be reſpected, as obedience or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo in his mouings, they are either orderly or diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, faſt or ſlow, dead-mouthed or tickle mouthed, &amp;c. Euen ſo in like manner, theſe two, (I meane the Head-ſtraine and trench, being alſo two) will reforme any reſtiffe or euill quality in what horſe ſoeuer if they be truly applyed; for though there be as many ſeuerall diſpoſitions as there are horſes, yet all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffe qualities that concurre (as I ſay) proceed all from one<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 32. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>
                        </note> cauſe, and ſo may bee reformed by theſe inſtrument (if they bee rightly vſed;) for as one horſe is a particulars horſe, and yet may haue many reſtiffe qualities, by diſorder and abuſe, ſo theſe

But thought I cannot make this ſo plaine as I would, in that there is ſuch ambiguity in the hand, which muſt be gouerned according to the ſhape, and diſpoſition of the Horſe; yet I will demonſtrate it ſo plainely as I can in treating cheifly of thoſe Horſes vpon whom the depth of Art doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Now becauſe the true mouthing of a Horſe, to cauſe him to ſtop cloſe, and to place his head orderly, are the grounds of this Art; you muſt haue a great regard that you fayle not in any of<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pra.</hi> 22. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 25. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>.</note> them, for if you doe you ſhall fayle of your deſire: for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whereof and of their true vſe, is the generall cauſe of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill quallities, which may inſue in riding.

                     <p>And yet further you muſt obſerue, (if truely you thinke to worke) that theſe muſt not conſiſt in the outward parts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his deſire muſt be agreeing, to doe them willingly or elſe they<note place="margin">(d) <hi>Theo.</hi> 36. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2.</note> will not continue: and this is the point that many hath fayled in, which hath beene the cauſe of ſo many torturing inuentions, as afore ſaid, for when they haue brought their Colt to doe theſe well, as they thinke, then when he beginneth to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or elſe any thing diſturbed, hee will either beare hard vpon the hand, or ſeeke to free himſelfe, by deſiring to runne away, and ſo they preſently ſought ſharper inſtruments for his head, thinking the other to be too gentle, iudging the cauſe to bee in too much lenity of the hand, whereas it was in his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for that his deſire was not agreeing to thoſe outward motions.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe it is the cauſe of rebellion in thoſe Horſes which are ridden for the Buffe ſaddle, for many if they be rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den longer then ordinary, or by long marching forward if they begin to be weary, they will rely too much vpon the hand,<note place="margin">(e)</note> whereby their mouth will become dead, and therefore they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>For inſtance, when as you haue trotted him forwad a little, and then ſtayed him, you ſhall ſtraighten your hand to keepe him from preſſing forward, and moue your ſelfe vp and downe in your ſeat, to keep his bodie ſtill in action. In which motion (if<note place="margin">
                           <hi rend="sup">a</hi> How to make your horſe trot ſide-wayes.</note> you would haue him goe on your right hand) you ſhall lay the left reyns cloſe to his neck, &amp; thruſt your left knee cloſe to that poynt, fitting moſt vpon your left buttocke, and putting your legge backe, lay it cloſe towards his flancke, and by laying
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1013:136"/> your ſticke cloſe to his left ſhoulder, you ſhall cauſe him to goe toward your right hand, which ſo ſoone as he doth, let him ſtand and cheriſh him, then make him goe towards your left hand, vſing the like on the contrary ſide, as the laying your right reyne to his necke, your right knee cloſe to that poynt of the ſaddle, ſitting moſt vpon your right buttocke, with the ſame legge cloſe to his flancke, and your ſticke vpon his right ſhoulder, cauſe him to goe on your left hand, and thus by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping your body mouing, vſe him till hee bee ſo perfect that hee will goe on either ſide, ſo ſoone as hee ſhall but feele the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reyne to either ſide of his necke, or your knee to the ſaddle, without any other apparant motion.</p>
                     <p>For, whereas I haue ſet forth to vſe ſuch manifeſt motions at the firſt, that any body may perceiue them, it is becauſe your Colt may the eaſilier diſtinguiſh of them, whereby he may the more eaſily conceiue of your minde, which after hee doth, you ſhall obſerue this as a generall rule (as well in all other leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<note place="margin">A generall rule.</note> as in this,) that as he hath knowledge of your will, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in cunning, you ſhall mitigate your motions (by little<note place="margin">

                     <p>When you haue brought him to ſuch perfection that he will trot as it were ſtanding, then you ſhall make him alſo trot ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, after you haue trotted him ſome diſtance forward, by giuing him the contrary motion aforeſaid, without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that hand you would haue him to goe on, for ſo hee will keepe the ſame time and grace in going, that hee kept in trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward.</p>
                     <p>Note, that if in this leſſon hee doth at any time preſſe hard<note place="margin">Note.</note> vpon the hand, and ſo deſire to goe forward, that then you giue him a ſodaine iert or two with the trench (in his mouth<note place="margin">

And yet thus farre I graunt they may doe well: that if a Horſe be of a temperate diſpoſition hee may be brought to an indifferent pace by them, (if they be ſet at the<note place="margin">

                     <p>But if he be a free Horſe that is to be put into them, (except

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1013:142"/> one they were not able to abide the cenſure, when they ſhall be tried by the effect in making a true going Horſe. For although<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 4.</note> there may be many inuentions, and diuerſe ſorts of Horſes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet there is but one truth, and one kind of well going; and that I dare affirme (hauing found it by practiſe) is onely the hand, for by it a Horſe may be refined to goe ſo eaſily, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the fineſt Lady, may make his backe her Cradle, to Lull her tender ſelfe a ſleepe.</p>

Secondly, it<note place="margin">(2)</note> is abuſed in the true placing of the Horſes body, for when hee is put to his pace before hee can tell how to carry it aptly for the ſame, hee cannot be brought to it, but by great violence: for they fall ſtraight to ſuch improper motions that all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities<note place="margin">

                     <p>Thirdly, it is abuſed, by ſhortneſſe of time, for when they ſee<note place="margin">(3)</note> that hee will not come to his Pace ſo ſpeedely as they expect, then paſſion doth ſtirre vp their will, and ſo force him to<note place="margin">

                     <p>But becauſe your ſelfe muſt be the chiefe efficient herein, I will firſt preſcribe what you muſt obſerue, whereby you may the more truely and eaſiy effect what you deſire.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore, this error is not ſo much in the horſe, (as ſome<note place="margin">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1013:150"/> ſtill feeling themſelues as farre from working reformation, by ſuch cruelties, as to bring a Lion to ſubiection by force.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe Maiſter <hi>Markham</hi> hath touched them ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Cauallarice, I will referre thoſe which are deſirous to be further reſolued therein to that place, for ſith their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences are there ſo indifferently portratured, I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſpend any time in the diſplaying of them here, they (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo farre degreſſing from the true Art:) for by their ſharpe and durable tortures, they make the Horſe as it were mad and ſenſeleſſe, becauſe he cannot feele eaſe when he yeeldeth.</p>

                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 18. <hi rend="sup">b</hi>.</note> experience my refuge) I dare maintaine; that any Colt may be kept free from any reſtifneſſe at the firſt, nay further,<note place="margin">

                     <p>And therefore, whatſoeuer reſtiffe quality may ſpring vp in<note place="margin">Reſtifeneſſe is ſowen by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.</note> this Vineyard, is ſowne there by the hands, either of mans igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or negligence, in either not obſeruing, or elſe not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to order his proceedings in ſuch ſort, as the Horſe might conceiue, how to obey his mind, but becauſe I would not<note place="margin">Reſtifeneſſe in ſtanding ſtill or going backe.</note> haue you ignorant altogether herein, I will ſhow briefely how theſe cauſes come from the man, and where to reforme them. Now the chiefe cauſe of ſtanding ſtill or going backe, is that he is corrected too much with the hand, or bridle, that he dare
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1013:150"/> not preſſe forward, and thereby when hee feeleth that hee cannot free himſelfe, from the correction of the body, he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill, to get breath to reſiſt, and ſo hauing eaſe becommeth<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pra.</hi> 23. <hi rend="sup">b</hi>.</note> reſtife, or elſe he goeth backe, thinking to free him-ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">How to reforme them.</note> ſith he cannot haue libertie to goe forward.</p>
                     <p>But you may reforme theſe faults, by letting a Foot-man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lead<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pr.</hi> 21. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>.</note> him gently forward, (as you did a Colt at his firſt backing,) till he be ſet on going, and let him goe which way hee will, letting him reſt moſt vpon the head-ſtraine, onely vſing (at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant) the helpe of your bodies motion, to let him know the vſe<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 29. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> thereof. Which when hee conceiueth, you may then adioyne<note place="margin">The cauſe of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe.</note> your corrections, to make him goe forward at your pleaſure. Now the cauſe of thoſe Horſes which are ſubiect to lye downe; is by the extremities of correction alſo, whereby he is made ſo<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 29. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> ſtubborne hee will lye downe vpon the leaſt diſcontent, for that at the firſt his correction not being proportionated according to his diſpoſition in ſtriuing to reſiſt, he by ſome accident chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth<note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to fall, whereby he diſmounteth the man, and ſo getteth a habit thereof: And for reformation hereof you ſhall (as afore)<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now if hee hath gotten that iadiſh tricke of ſtriking, the cauſe thereof may be as well from too little correction as too much, whereby he is not brought to true obedience, or that it<note place="margin">Not the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelfe, but the manner thereof preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> is increaſed by too much, and ſo will anſwere one blow for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for this the chaſe-halter is very good, for if he be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about in it, letting one follow him with a long pole; &amp; euer as he ſhall reſiſt double his ſtroks, &amp; what with the correction, and<note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the labour in running about, hee will preſently be reformed.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe, if hee be ſubiect to riſe before, or plunge, the<note place="margin">The cauſe of rearing and plunging.</note> cauſe of theſe alſo is in the abuſe of the hand, as well as in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for when they feele correction ſo ſharpe, and cannot
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1013:151"/> free them-ſelues by any meanes, they preſently fall to theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders (by the helpe of a heauy hand) thinking thereby to eaſe<note place="margin">To reclaime rearing.</note> themſelues. Wherefore if hee be apt to Reare, you may aſſay to keepe him downe by the head-ſtraine (for that will make his fore parts more heauy,) and ſo hee will be the more willing to preſſe forward: or if that preuaile not, euer as hee riſeth beate him downe with your ſticke betwixt his eares, or by ſtriking him vpon the knees, and that will cauſe him to keepe them downe: or elſe when you beginne to feele him riſe, keepe your hands firme vpon the head-ſtraine, and with your whole body turne him about, thruſting him forward with your legges, for this will reclaime him if the other fayle; if you be alſo carefull to keepe his body mouing, that hee hath not time to ſtand, till you feele his deſire ſomewhat abated. And for plundging, let<note place="margin">To reforme plunging.</note> him haue his head that hee hath no ſtay to reſt vpon you hand, and keepe him alſo in motion, for then he cannot haue time, nor leaſure, to frame his body thereto: for the letting him ſtay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hand giueth ſtrength to his fore-parts, whereby his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath the more help to rayſe his hinder parts.</p>
                     <p>And further, the cauſe of running away, and skittiſhneſſe, is for want of true obedience of the hand, and winde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The cauſe of running away &amp; skittiſhneſſe.</note> when hee is either diſpleaſed, or ſeeth any thing that is ſtrange, he is ready to runne away or fly on the one ſide, in that hee goeth not freely but vnwillingly, for his winde is kept to reſiſt vpon the leaſt occaſion, and then not hauing a perfect mouth, hee will runne away or skew more through ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">How to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime skittiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> then timerity. And therefore to reclaime skewing, or ſtarting, is to ſtirre him to a more quick going, and correct him on that ſide hee flyeth on without partiality, and cauſe him to goe to that, which he fleeth from, and then cheriſh him when he approcheth thereto, which will fortifie his bouldneſſe.</p>
                     <p>And for a runaway, though there hath beene many waies<note place="margin">How to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme a run-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> approued, yet the beſt (that I euer could finde) and the leaſt danger, is, to let one haue him in the Chaſe-halter, and your ſelfe being on his backe thruſt him into his galloppe, and when he deſireth to breake off, let him giue him a ſound twitch with the halter, and your ſelfe at the inſtant cauſe him to ſtoppe (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pr.</hi> 18. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> is ſhowne) at which if he will not yeeld vſe him ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1013:151"/> or third time, or till you feele him let his wind paſſe, and then let him ſtand, and cheriſh him, and thus you ſhall vſe him,<note place="margin">Note.</note> till you feele him yeeld to your hand, which he will doe in ſhort time, for this quality is moſt incident to hot fiery Horſes, which are neuer taught the true vſe of the hand at firſt, becauſe moſt<note place="margin">A lame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> think that when a Horſe goeth forward freely they are perfect, although otherwiſe they be moſt lame.</p>
                     <p>And further, the cauſe of ſtumbling, is in the vnapt handling<note place="margin">The cauſe of ſtumbling.</note> of his body in going, ſo that he hath not time to handle his feet, in ſuch order as he ſhould, in regard his hinder parts follow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then his foreparts can make way, (with true order,) and then<note place="margin">The habit of ſtumbling got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> he ſtumbleth, which commeth to a habit, by the abuſe of the hand: for if (when you feele him apt to ſtumble) you for feare hold in his head, (thinking thereby to preuent it) then you<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſhall increaſe it: becauſe you giue him a helpe to ſupport his body more then nature hath ordayned, whereby he will rely the<note place="margin">Nature the beſt ſupporter.</note> more vpon the hand, and when you ſlacke it neuer ſo little, that ſtay vpon which he truſteth fayleth him, and then he ſtumbleth<note place="margin">Stumbling is not reformed by ſpurring.</note> the more, Now this is not to be reformed by ſpurring (as moſt thinke) for if hee ſhall be but twiſe or thriſe corrected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſo ſoone as he ſhall but trippe neuer ſo little he will runne head-long forward, and thereby ſtumble more dangerouſly; But<note place="margin">How to reforme ſtumbling.</note> it muſt be reformed by changing the carriage of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> body, and letting him haue his head, for he is as fearefull of falling as your<note place="margin">No horſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fall.</note> ſelfe, is to haue him: and when his body is ſet for a true motion, and his luſt ſtirred vp more quicke, hee will take vp his legges more loftily, and ſet them forward orderly, if you temper your<note place="margin">

                     <p>And for enterfeiring, the cauſe thereof is not altogether in<note place="margin">The cauſe of enterfeiring.</note> nature (as is thought) but through the reſtraint of the hand that hee cannot haue liberty to moue his legges directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by two ſtraight lines (as he ſhould) but croſſeth his feet,<note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> whereby one ſtriketh againſt another. And therefore you may reforme this, (except nature be imperfect in ſhape) by giuing him his motion in the true place of his body, and letting him goe direct, vpon a pleaſing hand, for then he will handle them<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 4. <hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</note> ſo that they ſhall not ſtrike one againſt another: for he may goe narrow &amp; yet not enterfeire, if his body be firmely knit, as well

                  <p>Euen ſo, I (if it were lawfull) might except againſt the Creator, becauſe I am ſo inable that I cannot ſet forth to the world my mind in ſo plauſible a ſtile, as my heart doth deſire, through which defect, mens hearts

                  <p>But ſeeing I ſhall fare no worſe then many that haue gone before me, I am nothing danted, but am armed with patience, to bee a partaker with others of ſcande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous clamors; for (as one ſaith;) The inconſiderate multitude doe much reſemble dogges that barke at thoſe they know not; and likewiſe it is their nature to accompany one another in thoſe clamors: So it is with this ſort of people, who wanting that knowledge which reaſon requireth, and that louing affection, that Chriſtianity deſireth, condemne that they know not, and loath that they like not; but though ſome malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirits may deface it, yet many worthy breſts, (I hope) will imbrace it.</p>
                  <p>For the ſubiect or matter is worthy, and the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke (vpon which this plantation is framed) is true, though ſome ſtems of error may ſpring out of the earth, for there is no man which hath not his by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſlips, errors, and wanderings, but yet I haue purged this Vineyard from ſo many as my weake knowledge could diſcerne: whereby the young Impes ſhall not bee choaked, if it but vnderſtood by reading, as I conceiued in writing, (becauſe no man can infuſe Knowledge with his pen:) for (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) <hi>Vnumquodque recipitur per modum recipientis:</hi> Euery thing is receiued according to the natures of them that receiue it; for the Bee gathereth hony, and the Spider poyſon from one and the ſelfe ſame flower, but the cauſe of that diuerſity is not in the ſlower, but in their natures: And likewiſe the Sunne

                  <p>Wherefore, ſeeing mens fancies are as variable as their faces, both in regard that nature hath her greateſt delight in variety, as alſo, that moſt iudge either parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or as the eare or eye giueth euidence; the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without equity, the ſecond vncertaine, and the third doubtfull: becauſe that hauing no other euidence then the ſenſitiue apprehenſion of the eye, the heart gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſentence according to the exterior euidence, and ſo is deluded, in regard the eye is no ſubſtance of light (whereby it might inlighten, and ſo penetrate into other ſubſtances) but a thing which onely hath a procliuity and aptnes to receiue light from another by accidence, and therefore can ſee no further then the accidence of any ſubſtance; yet for all theſe ambiguities, I haue thirſted with a parching ſoule which will neuer bee quenched till I haue ſatisfied many of my good friends, for whoſe ſakes I haue attempted to plant this <hi>Vineyard of Horſemanſhip,</hi> in the World, to remoue thoſe that will be remoued from their ancient errors hauing deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into three Bookes.</p>

In which peregrination, becauſe there hath ſo many wandred out of the way, through the num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Imitation as a miſt darkeneth our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> of ſo many croſſe by-wayes that are trodden by the ſteps of thoſe which haue trauayled in the thick miſts and deſert places of the ancients; I haue taken paines to ſet downe notes in the margeant (at euery doubtfull turne) which will ſerue as guides to direct them when they are in diſtreſſe, and obliuion ſhould obſcure this path.

                     <p>And therefore, firſt for the ſcituation thereof, it would bee<note place="margin">All euill ſmels ſurfeits.</note> vpon drye and firme ground, ſo that he may come and go cleane to it in foule and winter weather, neither would there bee any filthy ſmel, priuy, hogsſtye, hen-houſe, or ſuch like, neere to it, to giue any filthy ſtench or vnwholſome ſauour; alſo there would<note place="margin">The walls thick.</note> be a channell (made currant) to euacuate the noyſomeneſſe of of his owne piſſe.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe, the walles would bee made very thicke, with bricke, or elſe ſome other ſtone, not only to make it ſtrong for being broken downe by knaues, but alſo to keepe both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of weather from him; I meane, that neither the cold windy ſtormes in winter doe inuade him, nor the heat of<note place="margin">The Stable cloſe and darke.</note> the reflection of the Sun in Summer annoy him, and ſo hinder digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, it would be made cloſe and darke, that when hee commeth from his labour (and hath fild his belly) he may take his reſt as well on the day as the night; and therefore it would bee remote a good diſtance from the noyſe of other horſes, which would diſquiet him.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, it would haue a window towards the Weſt (if it bee poſſible) to ſet open to giue light, whilſt he is in dreſſing,<note place="margin">Of Planking it. 1. <hi>Pra.</hi> 12. <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</note> and to let in Ayre at your pleaſure, and ſpecially to ſet open to coole and ſweeten the ſtable, whilſt he is forth in ayreing: And for the planchers, although ſome haue wiſhed to haue the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings paued, I cannot approue therof, ſome reaſons afore I haue ſhowne, and more I could ſhow if it were needfull; but I hold it the beſt to haue them laid with good Oaken planckes (two or three inches thicke) with holes bored through them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, to cauſe the waſh draine through them into the channell, which will keep the litter more ſweet and dry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it wil be the more wholſome for his body, and alſo they will

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1013:165"/> that will lye heauy in his maw, and be very vnwholeſome.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, there would be a loft made ouer him, to lay the<note place="margin">The loft would not be ioyned for ſhrinking.</note> haye and ſtraw therein, and the boards would not beioyned, but rapited one ouer another that no duſt nor filth fall vpon the Horſe (if they chance to ſhrinke,) whilſt his haye is in duſting and ſhaking aboue.

                     <p>IT hath been, and is ſtill an vſuall opinion of thoſe who haue a young Colt, and would haue him trayned vp either to hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The abuſe by cuſtome.</note> or courſing, that ſo ſoone as he is made gentle to backe, for to trayne him thereto altogether by lenity and gentleneſſe,<note place="margin">

                        </note> whereof he can neuer be brought to any great ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>And further, ſith they are neuer taught the true vſe of the ſpurre, when the free horſe hath done what he will of himſelfe, if he then be put to the ſpurre, he will ſettle to iuſt nothing: and if he be a ſad Horſe, one may aſwell ſtrike his ſpurres into a poſt (for motion) as into his ſides, (when he is any thing ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) and ſo is he vtterly defamed as vnworthy for any further vſe then the packe or plow.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when they are thus trayned, their body is neuer knit firme and round, whereby they can haue no ſleight in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage thereof, for if he be a long ſided horſe, he may take a large ſtroke at the firſt, (ſo long as he hath ſtrength) but when that fayleth, he cannot be able to bring his hinder parts after round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through which hee gathereth ſo ſlowly and runneth with ſuch paine, that a round running Horſe, though he take a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtroake, (if hee runne nimbly,) will beate him out of the field.</p>
                     <p>As for example, if two Horſes be to runne a courſe of 4. miles, and one of them ſtriketh 23. feet, and the other but 20. feete, yet in regard he that ſtriketh but 20. feete taketh 6. ſtroakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other 5. ſtroake, hee ſtriking 6. times againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 5. will ſtrike 120. feete, againſt the other 115. Now there being 1760. yards in a mile, there muſt needs be 7040. yards in 4. miles, and ſo 21120. feete, in which diſtance running, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, 5. feet in 120. will looſe, 880. feete in 4. miles, which you ſhall proue by multiplying 21120. which is the number third by 5. the ſecond number, &amp; the product will be 105600. which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by 120. being the firſt number, will be 880. feet, as you may ſee in the margent: which their ſpeeds are in proportion; as, 24. to 23. for as 5. is the difference betwixt 120. and 115. if 5. be deuided by 120. the quotient will be, 24. and likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided 5. by 115. it will be 23. Euen ſo, deuide 880. which is the difference of the exceſſes in 4. miles, by 21120. the complet number, and it will be 24. but deuide it by 20240. which is the leſſe exceſſe, and it will be alſo 23.</p>
                     <p>All which groſſe errors, are crept into this Art, vnder the vayle of following the Horſe after his owne nature, and many other which I could alledge if it were needfull, but for to clime

But as for thoſe that are growne and feſtred ſo faſt with them, that they are ſmothered in them, if I ſhould vnfold euery twiſt, to ſet them at liberty, yet they would not hold vp their heads to take freſh ayre.

                     <p>LIkewiſe there hath beene a neglect in this poynt, (to wit) of Raking, for that theſe horſes haue not beene rightly taught to goe orderly forward vpon their foot-pace, but are ſuffered to go according to their owne luſt therein; eſteeming<note place="margin">Want of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration makes waighty things of ſmall eſteem.</note> it a thing of ſuch ſmall moment (as it ſhould ſeeme) that the profit is not worthy of the time to ſtand vpon it.</p>
                     <p>But yet, if it be rightly conſidered, they ſhall find that there is as great knowledge to bring a horſe to a perfect foot-pace,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1013:167"/> as in another leſſon: Becauſe that except a horſe can demeane himſelfe well in this (as hee ought) he ſhall neither gallop true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor maintaine his ſpeed durably, (howſoeuer the contrary may bee imagined;) for that it is the ground of all other partes of Horſmanſhippe, (not onely in this but alſo in<note place="margin">The neceſſity of a true rake.</note> any other) as the Gamuth is, for him that learneth to ſing.</p>
                     <p>For there muſt bee as great care obſerued to haue him keep his deſire in continuall motion, and to carry a firme ſtayed body,<note place="margin">Theo. 33. 34. &amp; 35.

                     <p>For working the perfection whereof, it is meet you ſhould know when your horſe hath a true rake, and how to bring him<note place="margin">No man can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect truely that is ignorant of the end.</note> to it, leſt you wander out of the way (by ignorance) not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when you come to the period thereof, and ſo reſt before you come to your iournies end.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore know that a horſe neuer raketh truely, except hee goe forward willingly and coolely vpon a looſe hand, (as if he<note place="margin">The true order of raking.</note> were at his owne liberty, not hauing any body on his backe,) and that hee keepe the ſame time with his head (in his going forward) as hee doth with the motion of his legges, as if hee numbred all the ſteppes hee maketh.

For if a horſe hane many cloths<note place="margin">The abuſe of many cloaths.</note> clapt on him without need, they will keepe him ſo hot that he will ſweet too violently, and ſo make him faint, and take away
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1013:177"/> his ſtomacke, and alſo he will be the more apt to take cold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt occaſion that ſhall be offered.</p>
                     <p>Therefore (as Mr <hi>Markham</hi> ſaith) if you ſee that his coat,<note place="margin">How to know when to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe clothes vpon your horſe.</note> be ſlight and ſmooth, then you ſhall cloath him with a ſingle cloth, and as the weather waxeth colder, that his haire begin to ſtare, about his necke, flancke, or buttocks, then you ſhall adde another made of woollen cloth, which is an ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for a hunting horſe; for if hee haue any glutte within him thoſe two clothes, with the warmth of the ſtable, will bee ſufficient to helpe nature to expell her enemies: ſhee being the beſt Phiſitian.</p>

Then take a dead horſe taile, or a duſting-cloth of cotten, and<note place="margin">Of duſting and the bruſh.</note> ſtrike that duſt away which the curry-combe hath raiſed. Then take a round bruſh made of briſtles, and dreſſe him all ouer both head, body and legges, to the very fetlocks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1013:177"/> clenſing the bruſh from that duſt which it gathereth by rubbing it vpon the curry-combe.</p>

Laſtly, take a cleane cloth, and rubbe him all ouer till hee bee very dry, for that will make his coat ſmooth and cleane.</p>
                     <p>When you haue thus dreſt him take a woollen cloth, and lappe it about his body on both ſides, paſt his mid-ribbe, then<note place="margin">Of ſaddling.</note> ſaddle him, and throw the other ouer him for feare of getting cold.

And thus you ſhall vſe him morning, and euening for the ſpace of three weeks or a moneth, for by that time hee will be ſo inſeamed, that his fleſh will be hard and firme, and his mouth quickned, and his body brought to its former carriage.</p>

                     <p>THere are ſo many things that offer themſelues to be ſpoken of in this Tractate, that if I ſhould enter into all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to ſhew the errors, and cauſes, that are ſprung vp therein, it would require a very large diſcourſe. Therefore I will contract them into as compendious, and breife heads as I can, and (for breuity ſake,) ſpeake of the chiefe points, leauing the reſt to the conſideration of the diſcreet practitioner. Wherefore,<note place="margin">True labour cauſeth ability both of wind and body.</note> when you haue thus brought your Horſe to that ſtate of body that his fleſh is become firme and hard, (although he be not cleane, for heats by labour muſt effect that:) which you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the thickneſſe of his fleſh vpon his ſhort ribbes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhutting vp of his hucklebone; by the groſſeneſſe, and

                     <p>After you haue ſerued your Horſe for night, you ſhall come to<note place="margin">If he be not layd.</note> him early in the next morning, as about fiue of the clocke, and firſt ſift him the quantity of halfe a pecke of oates, (for they will be well digeſted by ſuch time as he be dreſt, and in the time of ranging to finde ſport:) which he ſhall eate, whilſt your are making cleane your ſtable: then you ſhall bridle him, and tye him to the bare racke, and dreſſe him: and after he is dreſt, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him, then throw his houſing cloth ouer him, and ſo let him<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 5.</note> ſtand till the Hounds be ready to goe forth. At which time you ſhall take his backe, rake him gently into the field vntill ſuch time as ſome game preſents it ſelfe vnto you.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it is the firſt day of his hunting: ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to behaue himſelfe vpon vneauen grounds; you<note place="margin">Haſt maketh waſt.</note> ſhall not put him at any time to aboue halfe his ſpeed, that hee may haue the better time to learne how to carry a ſtayd bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and handle his legges both vpon deepe and light earths.

Then draw his bridle, and giue him ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity<note place="margin">Note.</note> of prouender as you ſhall thinke good, but not ſo much as to take away his ſtomacke, which will be ſome-what weake through the heate of his body, and want of water: and putting haye in his racke, and taking away the looſe cloth for keeping him hot too long, let him reſt for two or three houres, or there<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pr.</hi> 6.</note> abouts: during which time you ſhall make a maſh ready, of halfe a pecke of mault, and put no more water to it, then it will ſweeten, and you thinke your Horſe will drinke, and let it ſtand couered till the water hath gotten the ſtrength of the malt,<note place="margin">Of making a Maſh.</note> which you ſhall perceiue, by your taſt, for it will be very ſweet, and alſo by your feeling, for it will be clammy like hony, and rope like bird-lime, which you ſhall giue him to drink when it is ſo cold that you can hardly ſee it ſmoke, leaſt the ſmoake ſhould ſtrike vp into his noſe, and ſo cauſe him to take a diſlike, and let<note place="margin">Though the ſmell be ſtrange to him at the firſt, yet the taſt will prouoke him.</note> him haue no other water that night: and therefore if he will not drinke it at the firſt, let it ſtand by him all night, and ſet it ſo that he ſpill it not neither with his feet nor head.</p>

                     <p>And for that cauſe I do not greatly approue that one ſhould goe into the field without ſpurres, for if a horſe commit a fault either through neglect or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doggedneſſe, if hee bee ſuffered at that time, the next time hee will bee the worſe; and I hold hee<note place="margin">A Horſeman is maimed if hee be vnfurniſhed.</note> is not meet to bee an Horſeman that cannot weare them, except hee abuſe them, for hee is like a mad man, that muſt haue his knife taken from him, elſe hee will doe miſchiefe with it.</p>

                     <p>SOme may thinke becauſe I haue ſpoken of no other food for the hunting horſe (in theſe laſt Chapters) but oates and hay, that I allow no other feeding for them, but to cleare that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the cauſe that I haue omitted to ſpeake of the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of foodes till now, was to auoyd digreſſion, for confuſing of order, and obſtupidating the memory of young impes, that<note place="margin">Theo. 4.

                        </note> this food which I ſhall preſcribe, is not ſufficient to bring a horſe to his ſtrength and purity of winde; becauſe it is not ſo<note place="margin">Nothing of eſteeme except it be curious.</note> coſtly and curious, as formerly hath beene ſet forth; for many thinke that nothing can bee good except it bee coſtly: but howſoeuer it may be iudged, yet I am ſure (hauing had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof) that this food will be ſufficient for the feeding and dieting of any hunting horſe, for giuing him ſtrength and ſound nutriment for the maintenance of his great toyle, and the neareſt to the helpe of nature; and ſo the reſt to bee ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, being inuented by ſome preiudicated fantaſies, that would be held ſingular, through too preciſe curioſity, or elſe<note place="margin">Generous minds wronged by Paraſites.</note> ſoyſted in by ſome Belialls, that would bring in great billes of charges, and reſerue the ſurplus, for themſelues to ſpend vpon their laſciuity.</p>

                     <p>And for the manner of feeding, let him eat one meale of<note place="margin">Of the manner of feeding.</note> Beanes and Oates, and another of bread, for ſo his ſtomacke will continue the better, for variety will ſharpen it; whereas if hee ſhould feed long vpon one kind, it would cauſe a loathing, and let him eat the oftneſt of that hee beſt liketh; or if you pleaſe, you may giue him both at one meale, (eſpecially if hee bee of a dainty feeding) alwayes giuing him that the laſt which hee eateth the beſt, and hath the beſt digeſtion, otherwiſe<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra. 6.

                     <p>And laſtly, it is oppoſite to Art, for if the Horſe be ſound, (as<note place="margin">(5)</note> this muſt be ſuppoſed) it weakneth nature, by violence, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her liberty and time to free her ſelfe, but will force a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution before there be any, and ſo hindereth nature, which Art tendeth to maintaine, for ſo long as a Horſe is ſtrong and luſty,<note place="margin">

                        </note> eate no more then will ſuffice nature: and it wil keep his body in good temper, for I haue ſeldome ſeene, that thoſe horſes which are full fed with ſuch meate to be ſubiect to coſtiueneſſe, and therfore I conclude, that thoſe horſes which are ſound &amp; ſtrong, need little other ſcowrings then good meate and their fill of it, if they be alſo ordered as they ſhould when they come into the ſtable.</p>

                     <p>Therefore becauſe I will not paſſe from one extreame and goe to another, but touch the meane, I will not ſleight them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">The meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames is the beſt.</note> as needleſſe, ſeeing they are good in their true vſe, but will ſet downe ſuch ſcowrings, as I haue found good, (by reaſon and experience:) and referre them that loues the multiplicity of them to Maiſter <hi>Markhams</hi> workes, where they may ſatisfie their deſires with variety.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if at any time, (through a ſoaring conceipt,) you<note place="margin">Which neglect is not greatly to be excuſed.</note> ſhall giue your Horſe ſuch a ſtrong and ſore heate that you finde it hath diſtempered his body, and it becommeth hard and bound, ſo that nature muſt haue reliefe or elſe it will turne to a greater euill: you ſhall take Rye meale, or the crummes of the<note place="margin">A ſcowring made of Rye and Butter. 2. <hi>Pra.</hi> 12. <hi rend="sup">f</hi>.</note> Rye-bread (afore expreſſed, in the laſt Chapter,) but the Rie crummes I rather preferre, and worke it with as much freſh and ſweet Butter, as will make it like paſte, and make balls of it to the quantity of a Walnut, and giue foure or fiue of them, in the morning faſting, and then (hauing his clothes truſt, faſt about him, and wadded round with wiſpes) get vpon his backe, and gallop him gently, in ſome greeue cloſe or yard, till he beginne to ſweat vnder his eares, then haue him into the Stable, and rub him well, and couer him warme, letting him ſtand vpon the bridle an houre or more.

                     <p>And therefore if hee be to runne ſixe or eight Trayne-ſents, and the courſe too and fro, let him not be put to ſuch ſore labour aboue twice in that month, and let them both be in the firſt fortnight, that he may haue the laſt fortnight of time to recouer
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1013:189"/> his ſtrength, and let all the reſt be ſometimes halfe his taske, and ſometimes three quarters, as you ſhall finde your Horſe in ſtrength and winde, but vſe no certainty for bringing him to that cuſtome. And let the laſt daies worke of the firſt fortnight be a Trayne-ſent more then your match, that thereby you may<note place="margin">How often he is to be exerciſed.</note> try his toughneſſe, and ſo repoſe the more vpon his truth. And likewiſe twiſe a weeke is ſufficient labour to keep him in breath, for ſo his ſtrength will not abate but increaſe.</p>
                     <p>But if your match be to runne fewer Traine-ſents, then you may oftner runne the whole number according to your owne diſcretion: prouided alwaies you ſtrayne him not (at the leaſt) for tenne daies before your match, leaſt hee ſhall not haue time<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra.</hi> 12.</note> to recouer his ſtrength. And giue him after euery breathing courſe a quantity of Rye bread to coole his body, and to keep it in temper.</p>

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1013:191"/>
                     <p>Which thing although it hath heretofore beene ſet forth by diuers that haue written of that ſubject, yet I haue approued of<note place="margin">Practiſe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth true eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> them by practice, that their order is very doubtfull, to bring almoſt any, much leſſe euery horſe to that ſubjection, without ſome inconuenience and danger.</p>
                     <p>For, whereas ſome haue vſed for the effecting hereof, to take him by the head as hee ſtandeth in the ſtable, and ſtrike him with a ſticke vpon his fore-legges, and ſo to vſe the helpe of his voyce, (as downe ſirra, downe, and ſuch like) and neuer to leaue ſtriking till he begin to bend in the knees, and ſo to vſe him till through feare of the blowes hee kneele downe, yet this is<note place="margin">The danger that ariſeth heereby.</note> both dangerous and doubtfull, for if hee be a churliſh and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne horſe he will indure many ſtroakes, before hee yeeld, and ſtriue to free himſelfe from ſuch correction by diſorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in regard he knoweth not wherefore he is ſo corrected, notwithſtanding all this, it is doubtfull whether hee will obey till hee be ſo ſore beat vpon the legges, that his ſinewes will be ſo ſore bruiſed, as hee will be in danger of laming, by ſwelling or putting forth of ſplints. But if hee ſhould, yet it would bring this inconuenience, that hee would be dangerous to ride into water, for if any thing ſhould but trouble his legges (by chance) hee would be ready to lye downe in the water, through feare of his former correction.</p>
                     <p>And againe, others haue counſelled to ſet him vpon good<note place="margin">How to cauſe him lie by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ſtore of ſtraw, and ſo tye his forelegges together, and faſten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother band to them, and caſt it about his fetlocke, on his farre hinde-legge, and ſo caſt him as they vſe to caſt Colts when they are gelt. Which although it goeth ſomewhat nearer the truth then the former, yet it is not tollerable, for it bringeth this inconuenience, that it will gaule a horſe very ſore behinde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fetlocks, by being ſo often caſt, as hee muſt before<note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of it.</note> he be brought to it, and if he be ſtubborne after he hath beene ſo vſed twice or thrice, that ſo ſoone as he perceiueth what you goe about, hee will ſet his legs ſo aſhore, that one man ſhall not be able to deale with him, and then the more violently that he is forced, the more he will ſeeke to reſiſt ſo long as is poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to preuent all theſe abſurdities, you ſhall (if his ſtanding be large) throw good ſtore of ſtraw vnder him, (as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1013:192"/> afore) then take a ſoft girth and tye the one end of it about his<note place="margin">How to make a horſe lye down willingly of himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger.</note> farre fore-legge, vnder his fetlocke, then with the other end tye vp his foot to the ſurſingle vnder his body, hauing a care that it be well wadded with ſtraw vpon his backe for pinching it, then take another girth, and caſt it twice about the narre fore-legge, vnder the fetlocke, for ſlipping vp, and holding both the buckles in your hand, ſet your right ſhoulder to his left, and vſing the helpe of your voyce, (as afore alſo) pull his foot from the ground, which being done, hee muſt of neceſſity fall vpon his knees, and being downe cheriſh him, and vnlooſe the girth vnder his belly, (which muſt bee tyed vpon a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knot,<note place="margin">Note well, for here is all the doubt.</note> for the purpoſe) and let him riſe with all his legges at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for if he ſhould be ſuffered to riſe afore it bee vnlooſed, he would feele a reſtraint, and ſo cauſe him ſtriue the more, and therefore if he chance to riſe before it be vnlooſed, cauſe him to goe downe againe, and make what haſt you can to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe him.</p>
                     <p>Then cheriſh him, and leaue him for an houre or two, after come to him againe, and vſe him in the like manner, and ſo foure or fiue times a day, and by the ſecond day at night he will kneele downe ſo ſoone as he ſhall but feele his legge tyed vp, though he be a very ſtubborne horſe. Which when hee will doe yet let him not reſt too long, for then he will think he hath<note place="margin">In euery leſſon there ought to be a daily addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till he hath learned it.</note> done what he ſhould doe, but after he will kneele downe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and haue no deſire to bring in his hinder-parts to lye downe, ſuffer him not to riſe ſo ſoone as hee would, but keepe him downe (by holding the girth ſtill in your hand) vpon his knees halfe a quarter of an houre (if need ſo require, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had ſuch need) and vſe the helpe of your voyce withall in ſaying downe, downe, and in two or three times ſo doing hee will couch his hinder parts, and lye downe of himſelfe, which when hee is downe cheriſh him exceedingly, and vnlooſe his girth, and let him lye ſo long as he will.</p>
                     <p>And when you haue vſed him thus a day or two, then you need tye vp his legge no more, for ſo ſoone as hee ſhall but feele you take vp his narre legge, and heare your voyce, hee will bend himſelfe to lye downe. Then to make him doe it more artificially, you ſhall take a ſticke and beat it vpon the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1013:192"/> ſtraw, and withall vſe your voyce, and hold the girth in your<note place="margin">The voice muſt giue him notice of your minde, otherwiſe hee will do it when his foote ſhall be taken vp to be ſhod.</note> hand, and ſo cauſe him to lye downe, and within tenne daies or a fortninght at the moſt (though he be neuer ſo vntoward) you ſhall bring him to lye downe ſo ſoone as hee ſhall but ſee you clap with your ſticke vpon the ſtraw.</p>
                     <p>But if his ſtanding be ſo ſtraite, that you haue not liberty, but as you deſire to haue him lye he reſteth againſt the wall, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, then you ſhall haue him into ſome empty houſe or barne where hee may haue ſtore of ſtraw vnder him, and vſe him as is ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>Now the vſe hereof is great both for pleaſure and profit, for it<note place="margin">The vſe thereof</note> is delightfull to the beholders, to ſee ſuch ſtrong and luſty creatures made ſo ſubmiſſiue by Art, and it doth ſet forth the loue and mercy of God towards man, that although theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue loſt that voluntary obedience, which they ſhould<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 1. 2.</note> haue yeelded to him if hee had ſtood in his firſt ſtate, yet hee hath left ſuch knowledge remaining in man as to repaire that decay (in ſome ſort) to the primary creation, by Art, ſo farre as is neceſſary for the vſe of him, that he might with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ponder and ſay with himſelfe, <hi>What is Man that thou art</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>ſo mindfull of him: and the Sonne of Man that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> And yet not to be proud thereof, but with true humility to giue him thankes for his Fatherly prouidence, in that he hath not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away that ſoueraigne rule, whereby theſe and all other creatures might haue beene without vſe (as we haue deſerued,) but to acknowledge it to proceed from his loue, ſith wee haue not any thing which we haue not receiued, for in him wee liue, moue, and haue our being.</p>
                     <p>And againe, it is very profitable for all ſorts of Horſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">What profit it bringeth in ſeruice.</note> they be for ſeruice, hunting, running, or trauailing. For if he be for ſeruice, if he will lye downe at command, it is a great eaſe for a man when he is loaden with his armour in getting vp into the ſaddle; and the Horſe alſo will take his eaſe more freely, (when he reſteth.)</p>
                     <p>And for either hunter, or courſer, it is very pertinent, for then aſſoone as he hath filled his belly, (at his times of feeding) and<note place="margin">What to the Hunter and Courſer.</note> his bed ſoft ſhaken, you may command him to lye downe, which will be a great preſeruer of his backe, and ſtrength, and keep his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1013:193"/> legs nimble and warme, what with the heate of his body, and the litter. And when he findeth eaſe thereby, he will take ſuch delight, that when he is weary with lying of one ſide, hee will riſe and lay him downe on the other, which will make him more able to endure his labour abroad.</p>
                     <p>And for the trauayling horſe it will make him ſo domeſticall, that all ſtrange places will be alike to him, for whereſoeuer hee<note place="margin">What profit to the trauayling horſe.</note> commeth, hee will couet to lye downe ſo ſoone as hee hath but ſlaked his hunger, (if he may haue but litter, and roome) which will refreſh him as much as his meat.</p>

                     <p>THe difference betwixt the exerciſe of a Running Horſe, and a Hunter, is not great, but onely in continuance of labour, for this dependeth vpon long and weary toyle; and that vpon a quicke and ſpeedy diſpatch.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra.</hi> 1.</note>

                     <p>Wherefore if you perceiue (either by his making or tryall) that hee will not indure any long time in ſore labour, and yet finde him to be of great ſpeed, then you muſt let his exerciſe be after ſuch ſort, as ſhall increaſe both his ſpeed and winde, which<note place="margin">Idem.</note> would be after this manner.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 19. Of Matching a Running Horſe and clearing the doubts.</head>
                     <p>THus hauing trayned your Horſe, and approued him to haue ſuch excellency, as you dare attempt to match him to run for a wager: you muſt be carefull leaſt you giue your aduerſary<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra.</hi> 14.</note> any aduantage againſt you, vnleſſe you will obſtinately looſe your money, and diſgrace your Horſe.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, (for making the better and ſurer match) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what cautions are ſet forth in the making of a Hunting match, and obſerue the ſame here, for I haue there ſet downe the chiefe things to be obſerued for ſuch Horſes as are to try their goodneſſe by long and ſore toyle, and apply them to the<note place="margin">More aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt courſers then hunters.</note> beſt aduantage your iudgement can miniſter: but becauſe there are diuers aduantages that there I omitted, for that they are not ſo appertinent to thoſe Horſes, as to theſe that are to diſpatch vpon a ſudden encounter, I will here touch them as ſummarily as I can, whereby you ſhall the better vnderſtand your ſelfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ow to cleare ſuch poynts, as would giue aduantage againſt you, and how the doubt of them extend.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, firſt obſerue to runne ſuch a courſe as is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to you Horſes diſpoſition; for if he be hot and very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">The horſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt be thus ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all matchs.</note> then the lighteſt, leauelleſt and hardeſt earths are the beſt: but if not ſo purely compoſed, ſo that he is more ſlow and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; then make your match to runne ſuch a courſe, wherein are deepe letches, and broken ſwarthes, that his truth and tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may recouer what ſpeede looſeth.</p>
                     <p>But here it is obiected, that an euen-leuell courſe is not ſo<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> good for a hot Horſe, becauſe that he will ſpend himſelfe outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, and ſo runne himſelfe out of winde.</p>
                     <p>I anſwere, that it is doubtfull to aduenture much vpon a horſe<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> that is of ſuch a bedlam diſpoſition as will not be gouerned but after his owne appetite, for then whether it be leuell or deſcent, he will runne ſo long as he is able, and then if hee be held any
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1013:195"/> thing hard to it, hee will yeeld vpon what ground ſoeuer, but if hee runne within himſelfe, ſo as hee is able to command the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">This is a great helpe.</note> at any time, then it may be thought that the deſcent of a hill will giue him the more breath, but (as I ſay) if the other hold him to ſuch a rate that hee ſhall not bee ſuffered to ſlake his ſpeed, then he ſhall finde ſmall reliefe thereby; for as it is a helpe to him, ſo it is to the other, and then if he haue not time to eaſe himſelfe when he climbeth vp the hill, his former eaſe will yeeld him no reliefe at all, if the aduerſe horſe bee true: And therefore that is but a thought indeed hauing no good ground,<note place="margin">Meere ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are meere ſimpleneſſe.</note> for the true tryall of this is, when there are ſome equality of ſpeeds to be compared: For although one may caſt a boule fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther downe a hill, then he can on a leuell ground, yet hee ſhall<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> looſe a greater aduantage when he commeth to caſt it as farre vp the hill, for then he muſt vſe his ſtrength the oftner to caſt it home, and yet the man hath more aduantage in caſting the boule vp the hill, then the horſe hath in running, for the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth conſiſt in the bowle, though the force come from the man, but both the horſes motion and his ſtrength proceedeth from himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore he that deſireth to runne ſuch a horſe vpon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withs and in-withs, for the better aduantage, ſeeketh helps by greater paine; by which it is plaine, that what horſe will ſpend<note place="margin">Note.</note> himſelfe diſorderly vpon leuell and eaſie grounds, wil doe more vpon vnleuell and ſtrong earths, howſoeuer it may be alleadged to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>And therefore if at any time you bee to runne againſt ſuch<note place="margin">A bedlam horſe hath ſmall help by deſcending grounds.</note> a horſe, (knowing your owne to bee true, and of good ſpeed) doe not repine to runne ſuch a courſe with him, for if that bee all his refuge and hope, his ſtay is no ſtronger then a reed that will breake with the winde, and his hope but Baſtard-like, that will neuer recouer inheritance, by reaſon there is no deſcent, but there is a climbing either before or after; where he will ſo choake himſelfe with his violent and diſgouerned running, that it will ſpend him twice as much as the deſcent ſhall helpe him.</p>
                     <p>And now for waights, though a ſmall difference bringeth a<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pra.</hi> 14. The aduantage of waights.</note> matter of moment in a hunting horſe that muſt indure long
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1013:195"/> time and toyle (according to the old Prouerbe, a lambe<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 1. 18.</note> will weigh an old ſheepe in a long carriage) yet it bringeth not ſuch diſaduantage in a running horſe, that muſt diſpatch his labour in a trice (in reſpect of the other) if the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence bee not too great, or the aduantage giuen the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſwifter horſe, (through ſimpleneſſe of iudgement:)<note place="margin">Halfe a ſtone is no great matter for foure miles if hee bee a ſtrong horſe.</note> For if the ſtronger horſe carry halfe a ſtone, or more then the other, that is not ſo very great aduantage (for a foure miles race) as it is thought to be; for it may be he is more able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that, then the other is to carry his weight, eſpecially if hee haue any thing the better of ſpeed, without either of which or<note place="margin">Wilfull folly is not to bee pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.</note> both, whoſoeuer will wilfully hazard himſelfe againſt the Pikes of his aduerſary, (by giuing aduantage in weight) he doth not deſerue to be pittied, or to haue a remedy giuen him for to cure his wound.</p>
                     <p>Yet becauſe there is no man but ſhall ſometimes bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached in making a match, I will ſhow you how the diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in waights may be mitigated, (ſo farre as reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath led me) whereby there will bee proued no ſuch great difference.</p>
                     <p>But firſt vnderſtand me, that I would not haue you too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in giuing aduantage thereof, vnleſſe you know aſſuredly, that you haue a greater difference in the goodnes of your horſe;<note place="margin">The beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to recouer the diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of waight.</note> yet if by any vrging occaſions you are brought into this relapſe, the next way you haue, is to feed ſtrongly, and breath ſo ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as is poſſible for the impairing of his ſtrength, and withall to traine a ſtone, or a ſtone and a halfe heauier then you are tyed to runne in your match, and likewiſe let your horſe haue heauy (but yet handſome) hunting ſhooes all the time you traine: For the feeding home maintaineth ſtrength, and ſound<note place="margin">Note the effect.</note> exerciſe cauſeth good winde and toughneſſe, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all carrying of ſuch an extroradinary waight, will ſo vſe him to ride with that burthen, that when hee ſhall come to ride his match, and is disburthened of that extraordinary waight, it will make him ſo light and giue him ſuch eaſe, that the waight will worke ſmall aduantage (for the other) in regard hee will haue runne his courſe before his ſtrength be ſo farre ſpent, as that waight ſhall haue power to worke any hinderance.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another aduantage which would not bee paſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1013:196"/> ouer without ſome taſt, whereby you may the better iudge<note place="margin">Aduantage by diſtance of way.</note> alſo how it is aduantage or diſaduantage, ſeeing it is not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as it ſhoweth in words: And that is to haue aduantage giuen you by a certaine diſtance of way, either at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or at the ending, or both. And therefore if your Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary knoweth his horſe to bee better then yours, and hee (to<note place="margin">Of ſtarting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> worke you in by cunning) offer to giue you twelueſcore, or a quarter of a mile aduantage, and ſo you to ſtart ſo farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you may bee deceiued therein, if your aduerſary runne with diſcretion: For it muſt bee firſt preſuppoſed that your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary hath the greater ſpeed, otherwiſe hee were ſimple to<note place="margin">A mans conceit is a weake Iudge.</note> giue any aduantage, and then when you ſtart you haue no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to runne by, but onely your meere conceipt; which being doubtfull, you may either (through feare) ſpend your horſe too faſt at the firſt, not knowing how you hold your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; or elſe ſuffer ſo long (leſt you ſhould ſpend too faſt) that he ſhall come vp to you, and then your aduantage is loſt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he hath alwayes before his eyes the diſtance of way that is betwixt you and him, and ſo feeling the running of his horſe, he may proportionate his rate ſo as hee ſeeth the part of the giuen diſtance gained anſwerable to the part of the race that is runne, and ſo hee may runne within himſelfe as occaſion ſhall afford.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another aduantage giuen, which is to ſtart both<note place="margin">To haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage at the laſt is the beſt.</note> together, and to haue ſuch a diſtance giuen you, as hee is to ouer-runne you, ſo many ſcore as you ſhall agree vpon, at the laſt, which is the better and ſurer, for ſo you haue not onely the aduantage of ſo much liberty, but alſo the like aduantage to proportionate the part of diſtance loſt, to the quantity of the race ſpent in running, (as hee had afore of you,) that you need ſpend no more then ſhall bee needfull; whereas hee running doubtfull (as you afore) muſt runne away ſo faſt at the firſt, leſt he ſhould not gaine that ground hee ſhould, that his horſe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be very tough) cannot maintaine it, and then you ſhall beat him in his owne play.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another aduantage, and that is to haue aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage<note place="margin">Aduantage vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aduantage.</note> of ſuch a diſtance of ground, both at the beginning, and at the ending, which may well bee called aduantage vpon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, for ſo the hindermoſt horſe muſt be kept at his full
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1013:196"/> ſpeed to recouer the giuen ground at the firſt, and then to gaine ſo much ground againe at the laſt, which is double aduantage, beſides the diſaduantage in iudgement of running (as before;) and therefore bee carefull how you giue that aduantage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you know your horſes ſpeed and toughneſſe, is in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other, as ſixe to fiue.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is another aduantage to bee giuen, which being rightly conſidered is rather a diſaduantage, and therefore may<note place="margin">Diſaduantage vpon aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> well be called a diſaduantage vpon aduantage, and that is to giue you ſo much ground at the ſtart as ſhall bee agreed vpon, and you to keepe the like diſtance ſtill at the later end, in which through the vncertaine grounds, the man hath to proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his ſpeed, it includeth all the other inconueniences, being directed by nothing but a ſlippery imagination, and ſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter horſe may be ſhamefully beat.</p>
                     <p>And thus I haue briefly ſet forth the ſeuerall aduantages with their differences; but before I conclude, I will now proue my former aſſertion, that a horſe which runneth hot at hand, but<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 18. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. (m)</note> will not hold it, cannot be truely ſaid to be of ſuch ſpeed as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horſe that is not altogether ſo ſpeedy at the firſt, but yet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.<note place="margin">Euclid. 4.

                     </p>
                     <p>For inſtance, take a number as 20. and deuide it firſt into two equall parts as 10, and 10. and let that bee ſuppoſed the<note place="margin">

                        </note> tough or whole running courſe; then take the ſame number againe and diuide it into two vnequall parts, as 15. and 5. and let that be imagined the hot running horſe: Now multiply 10. by 10. and the product will bee 100. then multiply 15. by 5. and that product will ariſe but to 75. and yet you ſee that 15. and 5. added together maketh 20. as well as 10. and 10. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 20. although the product of that is not ſo great as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this by 25. And the reaſon is, that the difference of the exceſſe from 10. which is the meane, (being 5.) is not multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally in it ſelfe: for 5. being the multiplyer, multiply 10. by 5. and it yeeldeth 50. and multiply 5. by 5. becauſe it is the exceſſe, and it produceth 25. which being added to 50. maketh 75. as afore; but multiply 5. againe by it ſelfe, and it bringeth 25. more, which being added to 75. maketh 100 anſwerable to the product of 10. and 10. ſo that you ſee, though 15 is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1013:197"/> more then 10. and hath the vantage at the firſt, yet 5. is leſſe then the other 10. by the ſquare of 5. which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and ſo looſeth that aduantage by the quantity of the ſquare of the exceſſe, as is demonſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Euen ſo, the whole running horſe (though not altogether ſo<note place="margin">Note the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> ſpeedy at the firſt) holdeth his ſpeed from the firſt to the laſt, whereby there is no loſſe, but produceth the beſt aduantage, as it doth being multiplyed in it ſelfe, but the vnequall or falſe running horſe, although he haue the aduantage at the firſt, as 15. hath of 10. to the outward ſenſe, and ſo may hold it halfe the courſe, nay it may be ¾ as to 75. yet by reaſon that his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tended not to the meane, but to the exceſſe, hee will looſe that aduantage at the latter end, in as much as hee hath a leſſe proportion of ſtrength and winde to maintaine him at the laſt, and ſo the further he runneth, the more hee ſetleth, as the laſt fiue doth of the laſt 10. whereby it is playne that long and true training doth not pull a horſe from his ſpeed, but rather increaſeth it although he runne not ſo violently faſt at the firſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pra.</hi> 18. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> as hee did, ſeeing true and whole running horſes are to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the ſwifteſt horſes, and doe worſe the other which reſted to be proued.</p>

                     <p>And for his cloathes, whereas before (during the time of<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra.</hi> 9.</note> his training) he had no more then an ordinary hunting horſe, yet now when he is kept for a match, he ſhall haue more ſtore,<note place="margin">The profit of many cloaths.</note> not onely to keepe his body in ſuch a moderate naturall heat, as ſhall be able to diſſolue any raw or groſſe humors, (if they ſhall abound) which would bring ſome impediment to the horſe, if they ſhould be ſuffered, for thereby the heat ſhall ſtill be able to diſperſe them into the outward parts, and ſo expell them away by ſweatings as he ſleepeth, which will be a great meanes to purge his body, and to keepe it pure and cleane; but alſo they will make him very agile and nimble: for hee being vſed to be peſtred with ſo many cloathes, when (as Mr. <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaith) hee commeth to bee ſtript naked for to runne his breathing courſe, he will feele himſelfe ſo light and pleaſant, and feele the coole ayre ſo peirce him, that hee will deſire to runne with what ſpeed and courage his ability is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>

Wherefore for an ordinary quantity of cloathes; Firſt, take a<note place="margin">How to cloath a running horſe</note> narrow peece of Cotten and caſt it round about his body, to lappe about his heart, hauing a breſt-plate about the bredth of halfe a yard, to tye before his breſt; and next that take a cleane linnen ſheete and couer all his body therewith, for that will be pleaſing and cleane for his body, and keepe him from what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance might offend him by ſweating, either by his foulenes, or extraordinary warme keeping; for the heat of his body will dry it as ſoone as nature ceaſeth working, and the humors eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated: and next aboue it lay a woollen blanket, or a cloth made of thicke cloth, and next that a houſing cloth made of canuas, and aboue all another made of ſtrong ſackcloth; and let all theſe bee made ſo large as they may, to tye cloſe vpon his breſt, to keepe his hart warme, for there hee is in the moſt danger of

                     <p>And therefore it bringeth this profit, that the ayring euery morning and euening: Firſt, it purifieth the blood and purgeth<note place="margin">(1) (2)</note> it from groſſe humors, (if the ayre be cleane and pure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it helpeth his winde (by exerciſe) and learneth him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne the motions thereof, to agree reciprocally with the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or motions of his body, by ſuch a common, frequent, and mediocrite practiſe.

                     <p>COncerning the watering of a running horſe there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt ſome mens opinions and mine, but becauſe I haue ſpoken thereof heretofore, I will but touch their opinions briefly, and referre the taking or leauing of them, as (in their iudgement) they ſhall finde reaſon to perſwade. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it hath beene a cuſtome to water a running Horſe in the houſe, and to haue him drinke but once a day, and likewiſe to put Liquoras, or ſuch like, into the water to helpe his winde, all theſe I doe except againſt, and why?</p>
                     <p>For (firſt) watering in the houſe is very hurtfull, for if he be any<note place="margin">Of leting a Horſe drinke in the houſe.</note> thing ſubiect to take cold, it will be nouriſhed by drinking cold water, (if he be not heated after:) becauſe that wateriſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are enemies to a horſe, and will increaſe vnnaturall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities:<note place="margin">Note this Simile.</note> for as ſtanding water doth putrifie &amp; gather filth, ſo will a horſe gather much corruption, and excrementall humors by drinking cold water, if the coldneſſe be not mitigated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, to diſperſe the naturall heate into all the parts of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1013:200"/> body. And further, if hee ſhould drinke at any time (in the houſe) after labour, before his radicall moiſture hath quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">The danger of letting a horſe drinke and not heated after.</note> that exceſſe of heate gotten by labour, the receiuing of cold water ſuddenly into his body, (and not hauing any exerciſe to heate the ſame) will ſo ouerſway the quantity of naturall heat, that it will benumbe his body and make him ſhake, and ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard either the mortall diſeaſe of foundring in the body, or elſe hinder concoction, with ouer raw humors, ſo that he cannot haue good digeſtion, for want of which, vnwholſome crudities will ingender.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pra. 6. 2.

                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore water your Horſe as little as you can in the houſe, but let him fetch it abroad, that you may heate it in his body by galloping, and ſo preſerue him from ſuch dangers as may inſue thereby.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if he drink but once a day, his body will be brought<note place="margin">Whether a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning horſe ſhould drinke oftner then once a day.</note> very dry and coſtiue, in that it cannot haue ſufficient moiſture, to quench that exceſſe of naturall heate, which will abound, if he be reſtrained from drinking when the neceſſity of nature requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and ſo that heate will get ſuch prodominancy of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall moyſture, that he will dry too faſt the moyſture, not hauing a proportionated quantity to keepe his body in a meane temper<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> for the nouriſhment of nature, and ſo cauſe an inflamation and diſtemperature of the whole body, for as too much oyle quencheth the light of the lampe, ſo if it haue too little, it will conſume more ſpeedily.<note place="margin">A running horſe would be watered as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he is ayred.</note>
                     </p>

                     <p>THere are many that make a kinde of ſuperſtition in feeding a running Horſe, (aboue a hunter:) which is rather to make it ſeeme more curious then neceſſary, for thereby they allude ſo much to feeding, that they take away the Art of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 12.</note> holding it to be the onely meanes to bring him to his higheſt perfection both of ſtrength, courage, winde, and ſpeed.

                     <p>And therefore to abandon curioſity, you ſhall vſe him, (for the firſt fortnight after he is matched,) in all reſpects, as you did the hunting horſe, (for his kinds of meate, quantity, manner<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra. 12.

Onely whereas I wiſhed to giue him a quantity of prouender in the morning before his water, you ſhall giue this nothing, except it be a new layd egge or two, downe his throat, before he goe forth to be ayred: at the end
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1013:202"/> of which fortnight if you perceiue that hee hath gotten an able and ſtrong body, and that the beanes cauſe purſiueneſſe, ſo that he ſweateth too much in his breathing courſes, you ſhall for the laſt fortnight take the beanes cleane away, (except he be a dainty feeder, which then you ſhall vſe ſometimes, ſtill to ſtirre<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 12.</note> vp his appetite,) and feed him with the beſt bread preſcribed for the hunter, very ſoundly; for it is very ſtrong and of good digeſtion, and helpeth the winde.

                     <p>With theſe meates you ſhall feede him the laſt fortnight ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one, and ſometimes with another (but let bread be<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pra.</hi> 12.</note> his cheife feeding,) giuing him euery meale ſo much as he will, but onely the night before you intend to giue him his brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing courſe, (in the morning,) when you ſhall feede him more ſparingly, that his ſtomacke may be empty, leſt if you giue him<note place="margin">Note.</note> his heate before his meate be concocted, the exceſſe of heate cauſe too ſudden digeſtion, and ſo oppreſſe the ſtomacke with raw crudities, and cauſe ſickeneſſe or loathing the meat: either of which is ſufficient for the loſſe of a match.</p>

But if hee be a ſore and groſſe feeder, (that he will eare his litter, or gnaw the racke, or walles,) let him weare it the whole fortnight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<note place="margin">When to muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſle a ketty fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> it be the night after his breathing courſe, which then (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he is) let him feed at his owne pleaſure both of haye, and bread that night, for the haye will doe him no harme, ſo it be ſweet and cleane duſted, for it will be cleane digeſted out of his body before the next breathing day: through which liberty he will ſo fill his belly, and take his reſt ſo kindly (not hauing any thing to diſquiet him) that he will be ſo freſh and luſty the next day, as if he had done nothing the day before: but after you ſhal let him haue no more hay, but onely a little which he ſhall pull<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pr.</hi> 15.</note> out of your hand, to clenſe his teeth after his feeding.

And further, I haue ſeene a horſe, that when he was led for his courſe which hath dunged ſo hard, that all the field hath paſt a definitiue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, and yet he hath returned conquerer, though he was thought ouer-hard matched, and a man may be bound in his body, but feele no impediment thereby. Wherefore if your horſe chance to be bound, if you know it is not vpon any doubtfull cauſe, and that he hath not beene long ſo, or that his<note place="margin">Of two euills the leaſt is to be choſen.</note> countenance is not caſt downe, or his belly not ſhrunke vp in the waſt, yet hee may make a good courſe, for of the two it is better he ſhould be hard then ſoft, and therefore as it is, ſo it is doubtfull to be iudged of.</p>
                     <p>But if his body be laxatiue and his dung ſoft, then it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible<note place="margin">Soft dung ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> ſigne of weakneſſe, becauſe nature is hindred by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, (howſoeuer others hold,) and therefore whether the cauſe thereof bee knowne or vnknowne to you; it will ſoone weaken, and therefore preuent it (ſo ſoone as is poſſible) as an enemy to nature. And alſo if it bee greaſie and ſlimy after his heat, it is a ſigne of foulenes; and here it bringeth into my mind to anſwer a doubt, which I heard oppoſed betwixt two, and<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> the queſtion was, becauſe that a horſes dung is greaſie after his heat, whether there were any fat growing on the inſide where the excrements are or no? To which I anſwer briefly, no; for<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> if it were ſo, the expulſiue part could not haue force to expell the excrements, becauſe they would be hindred from paſſage, by the roughneſſe of the knots, and thereby retained ſo long therein, as it would burne and ſcald the body: and when the horſe were fatte hee could not auoyd his excrements at all, by reaſon it would grow ſo much as it would ſtop the paſſage, and ſo cauſe an vtter ſubuerſion.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note>

                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1013:206"/> I anſwere, that as nature hath giuen an attractiue faculty to diſperſe the nutriment of the food, from the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue part, into euery part of the body, to nouriſh and maintaine the ſame, paſſing through the arteries, veynes and pores, euen ſo likewiſe hath it giuen an expulſiue faculty, to expell from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part any excrement, that might offend or hurt it (by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But for the colour of dung, after the horſe be once cleane, it is<note place="margin">The colour of his dung is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull.</note> alſo deceiptfull, for it may be blacke or tawny, by too long kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the body, (the horſe not hauing alwayes a like appetite) and yet not much hurtfull to him; and againe, (before hee bee cleane) hee may haue his dung of a perfect colour, not being exerciſed truely to heat it, and alſo by ſcowrings or ſuch kind of feeding as many vſe, which then is like but a counterfeit peice gilt ouer: but if you haue all theſe Characters in the beſt, and your owne practiſe telleth you they are true, then you may affirme, his body is of as perfect ſtate as Art and Nature can performe.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore ſeeing ſweates bring ſuch benefit and profit, let<note place="margin">Sweats are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in their true vſe.</note> them be vſed ſo as they may produce the beſt effect, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge hereof, they are giuen to a Horſe, three manner of waies.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and beſt is to giue him his ſweat abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">(1) The beſt way to giue a ſweat.</note> his cloaths, as your breathing courſes; for it is giuen by action both of winde and body, and is moſt naturall, becauſe the heate proceedeth firſt from the vitall parts within, and ſo doth driue thoſe humors, which are diſſolued, to the outward parts which is diſtilled through the pores of the skinne, and ſo aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that ſuperfluity.</p>
                     <p>The ſecondly way is to giue him his heate alſo abroad, but<note place="margin">(2) The ſecond way to cauſe a ſweat</note> then it muſt be in his cloathes, which is not ſo kindly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, for where the other had the heate beginning firſt from within, this is more violent, becauſe the thickeneſſe of his cloaths adioyned to his exerciſe forceth the heate more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and ſo abateth his ſtrength the more, and yet doth not bring him to ſuch purity of winde as the former, becauſe it hath
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1013:207"/> not the like exerciſe, nor the humors is not ſo naturally expeld from the vitall parts.</p>
                     <p>Now the laſt is the worſt of all, which is to giue him a ſweat<note place="margin">(3) The third and worſt way to cauſe a ſweat.</note> in the houſe, by heating cloaths and loading him therewith till he be forced to ſweat without any motion, Now (as I ſay) this is the moſt vnnaturall and worſt, being altogether violent, for it is prouoked onely from the outward parts, (hauing its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there) by the heate of fire, and of the cloaths that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, which caſteth the Horſe into ſuch extremity of<note place="margin">Sweating in the houſe as ill as a ſtoue.</note> heate, that it (as it were) ſmothereth his vitall ſpirits, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him as if it were a ſtoue: whereby it doth farre more hurt, then any way good.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, if through the vnſeaſonableneſſe of the weather you cannot giue your horſe ſuch a heat neare vnto your race, as you would, rather then you vſe either of theſe violent ſweats, go halfe a dozen miles to ſeeke a place where you may breathe him, which though it be but halfe a mile, yet it may be inlarged by often doubling, which will worke farre better effect then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">A ſlender natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by cloaths.</note> of the other, for you dwell in a very vnfit place if there be not ſuch a plot in that diſtance, either of dead fog or ſandy way to yeeld you that releife.</p>
                     <p>But if your horſe be an old ſtrained horſe, yet recouered again, but ſo as you dare not heate him when the weather is hard (by froſts) for renewing it, whereby you are in danger of looſing the wager, then you may make a vertue of neceſſity (although I would not wiſh any man to be too confident in lame Horſes,) and giue him his heate abroad in his cloaths firſt, by galloping him till he be in a full ſweate, which when he is, haue him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently home, and ſtraw good ſtore of litter vnder him, and laye more cloaths vpon him, then ſtuffe him round with great wiſps round about his heart &amp; before his breſt, &amp; ſo keep him ſtirring to and fro for halfe an houre, hauing a cloath to wipe the ſweat from his face and neck, as it ariſeth: and when he hath ſweat ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, abate his cloaths by little and little, till he come to his ordinary cloathing, then rub him and vſe him as after his brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing courſes, and let the firſt drinke he drinketh be a warme to maſh, for that will cauſe the groſſe humors that are diſſolued purge away with his dung, &amp; it will alſo comfort him after that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1013:207"/> peircing ſweat, but in any caſe I would not wiſh you ſhould giue him this kinde of ſweate after the laſt fortnight, for it will wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him ſo much, as that will be time little enough to recouer himſelfe; But for the laſt manner of ſweating I will ſpend no time about it, becauſe I would not wiſh any to vſe it, for that horſe which is ſo lame that he will not indure to gallop in his cloaths till hee ſweat, is not fit for any man to hazard money on, except hee haue ſo much hee careth not what becommeth of it.</p>

                           <hi>Theo.</hi> 1.</note> not ſome meanes of reſtitution to their primary eſtate by Art: the deſire of which, was the cauſe that this Art was inuented:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theo. 26. Theo. 3. Pr. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. Theo. 8. 2.

                     <p>And alſo, that the cauſe of reducing a horſe to his beſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is the reforming of mans corrupt qualities, by ſubjecting<note place="margin">Theo. 8. &amp; 9. Theo. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. Et multis alijs.</note> his will and all his paſſions to be gouerned by reaſon, to make the whole horſe agree (both in action and motion) together in his interior and exterior parts, being gouerned by the man, that both man and horſe may be ſaid to bee but one body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the man is a reaſonable creature, and hath the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the horſe, and the faculty of diſcipline to bring a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall concord.</p>
                     <p>All which I haue indeuored to explaine as methodically and as plainely as I can, for I confeſſe that my imperfections are ſo great (for wit, learning and wririting) that I am farre vnable to diſcharge and performe ſuch an intricate enterpriſe, as my good intenſion hath vndertaken; yet I had rather vtter my barbarous<note place="margin">A good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion excuſeth Barbariſme.</note> rudeneſſe to lay open the abuſes thereof, then with a fearfull ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to haue the truth defaced; wherein though ſometimes I may miſſe the marke, yet I haue not ſhot ſo farre as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of deteſtable error.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I deſire thee (learned and iudicious Reader) that if I haue paſt any thing obſcurely, that may ſeeme doubtfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Nature hath not giuen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in all things to one man.</note> the weak and ſimple Reader, (through the harſhneſſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, (for I oftentimes conceited more then I could well vtter) to aſſiſt him with thy vnderſtanding and knowledge, leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in doubt, hee take the wrong path, and wander out of the way.</p>
                     <p>But for Calumnies which wound and diminiſh others fame,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1013:210"/> by words, and ſtrikes and peirces through other mens workes, by the all peircing darts of their venomous tongues, I aske neither ayd nor fauour of ſuch a filthy and pernicious ſect, which cannot be auoyded.</p>
                     <p>Of the which Viperous kind, <hi>Iuſtus Lipſius</hi> hath very worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted out, whereby they may be diſcerned in their colours;<note place="margin">Iuſtus Lipſ. <hi>de oratione calum.</hi>
                        </note> for he holdeth them filthy and loathſome, filthy in that they are baſe, idle, and pratling, and ſo loathſome hauing the name of filthineſſe; baſe for that no generous and good ſpirit hath euer<note place="margin">How Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are ſaid to be baſe.</note> beene ſtained with that ſpot, but onely ſad and maligne natures that enuy others and diſtruſt themſelues: and ſo like little dogges barke at gueſtes, which free minds commanded entertainment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are idle, for no man hath leaſure to enter into<note place="margin">How they are ſaid to bee idle.</note> other mens affaires, that hath imployment of his own buſineſſe: but for want of that, all their whole imployments are in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and talking, ſo that no report of any man can ſtand before them vnblemiſhed or vnſlandered, but what ſhould I repine at theſe, ſeing neither King nor Counſel can be free from their idle braines: for whatſoeuer is done by them either publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, is by theſe cenſured and ſcourged.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, they are pratlers, for as they ſpeake much, ſo they ſpeake much euill: and all their talke is not only of ſome body,<note place="margin">How they are pratlers.</note> but againſt ſome body; mingling things true and certaine, with things vaine and vncertaine, for they being ignorant buſie themſelues with thoſe things, to whoſe height their ſenſe and vnderſtanding cannot reach.</p>
                     <p>Now this Sect muſt needs be wicked and prodigious, ſeeing they are begotten by ſuch viperous monſters: for Lying and<note place="margin">The Parents of Calumniators.</note> Enuy are their Parents, and Curioſity their Nurſe; for Lying aſpires and animates Calumny, without which it languiſheth;<note place="margin">Lying their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> for what Backbiter was there euer that contented himſelfe with the truth, in regard that ſo he hath no power to hurt, for ſo hee ſhould faile of his purpoſed end: and therefore that they may wound the ſorer, they will not ſticke to adde, and attract others fame, ſo that if there be any doubtfull ſpeech or ſentence, they wil chooſe the worſt ſenſe; and therefore as the Phiſitions ſay of their cupping glaſſes, that they draw out nothing but impure
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1013:210"/> blood: ſo I may truely ſay of a ſlanderer, that hee neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> nor receiues any thing into him that is not euill.</p>
                     <p>And againe, Enuy is their mother, who in the malignant wombe of her wit conceiues and brings forth thoſe impious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;<note place="margin">Enuy their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> for they neuer ſeeke to defame meane and ſimple people, but ſuch as they ſee eminent in ſome extraordinary vertue or qualitie; or in ſome other thing worthy of admiration.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, Curioſity is their Nurſe, for if it did not nouriſh them, they would haue nothing to liue on, for through theſe<note place="margin">Curioſity their their Nurſe.</note> curious inquiſitions they are neuer at home but alwayes ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging abroad, asking what newes of this man? what eſtate hath that man? what credit or vertues hath ſuch a one? And ſo they curiouſly deſire to pry into all mens affaires, altogether ſeeking their infamie by their opprobrious ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>Many other deteſtable qualities doth he repeate of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated ſect, which I omit for breuity; onely theſe haue I ſummarily collected, to giue approbation for the detecting of their malicious and enuious hearts, for though they ſpeake friendly to a mans face, yet ſo ſoone as hee is departed, will ſpeake any thing that may worke his diſgrace and ouerthrow; who are branded with all diueliſh deuiſes, which being laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the World, may bee the better knowne by their proper markes, when they ſhall enuy any thing that may bring a future good to them that ſhall afterward ſucceed.</p>

                     <p>But here it may be objected, that if I be ſo ignorant in the<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> knowledge of the nature of ſimples, I may be condemned of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency with the former tancke, in vndertaking to cenſure of other mens iudgements in that thing I haue no knowledge.</p>
                     <p>I anſwere, that if I ſhould compare my knowledge with<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> theirs I am not much inferior, as concerning a generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for I know, and can ſay, that the fire is hot and dry, and the water cold and moiſt, and that ſuch an herbe is hot, or moyſt, in the firſt, ſecond, or third degree, &amp;c. yet for particular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">A generall knowledge is but flowing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply particularly</note> to ſhow in what quantity they are ſo, and how much they differ, &amp; in what different quantity in each ſeuerall degree, to make a compound, agreeing to the nature of the Horſe, and ſo to apply particularly, in theſe I ſay I haue ſmall iudement, for that which is ſpoken of in generall, is not ſpoken to any in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
